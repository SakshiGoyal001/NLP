      "['In the animated adventure Despicable Me 3, Felonious Gru and Lucy Wilde, married agents of the Anti-Villain League (AVL), are tasked with thwarting the plans of Balthazar Bratt, a former child star turned villain. After failing to secure Bratt and the stolen Dumont Diamond, they are unceremoniously fired from the AVL. Their personal lives are upended when most of their Minions leave, and Gru discovers he has a twin brother, Dru, who lives in wealth and wishes to become a villain like their father. As Gru grapples with his identity and reluctance to return to villainy, Bratt steals the diamond again to execute his revenge on Hollywood. The brothers eventually team up to stop Bratt, leading to a series of misadventures that test their bond, culminate in a dramatic rescue mission, and finally, bring the family closer together. Despite initial tensions and conflicts, the story ends on a high note with Gru and Lucy’s reinstatement into the AVL and a renewed sense of unity among the characters, setting the stage for further adventures.', '* * *', 'Illuminat…', '(CHUCKLES)', '(CLEARS THROAT) Illuminat…', '(GIGGLES)', 'Illuminat…', '(SPEAKING MINIONESE)', '(FARTS)', '(SNIFFS AND GROANS)', '(GIGGLES) Illumination!', '(FARTS) (GROANING)', 'The year was 1985, and the number one show on TV was…', 'Evil Bratt!', 'HOST: The show starred young Balthazar Bratt as a child prodigy and criminal mastermind bent on world domination.', '(LAUGHING) There he is!

Jesper is about to give up when he finds an ally in local teacher Alva (Rashida Jones), and discovers Klaus (J.K. Simmons), a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys. These unlikely friendships return laughter to Smeerensburg, forging a new legacy of generous neighbors, magical lore and stockings hung by the chimney with care.
