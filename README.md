# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning models to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Semantic Analysis
Semantic Analysis is the process of understanding the meaning and interpretation of words, phrases, and sentences in context. It involves extracting the relationships between words and the underlying concepts they represent to comprehend the overall meaning of the text.

Topic Modeling
Topic Modeling is a technique used to uncover the hidden thematic structure in a large collection of documents. It identifies topics that are present in the text and clusters similar words together, helping in organizing and summarizing large datasets by topics.

Text Generation
Text Generation involves creating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input. Using models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based models (such as GPT), text generation systems can produce human-like text for various applications such as chatbots, content creation, and more.
