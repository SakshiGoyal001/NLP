    "# Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the sentiment of the various transcripts, both overall and throughout the comedy routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment of Routine\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentiment of Routine Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of looking at the overall sentiment, let's see if there's anything interesting about the sentiment over time throughout each routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classify all comedian according to Polarity and Subjectivity.\n",
    "2. Modify the number of sections the comedy routine is split into and see how the charts over time change and again classify all movies according to Polarity and Subjectivity.\n"

       "[['In the animated adventure Despicable Me 3, Felonious Gru and Lucy Wilde, married agents of the Anti-Villain League (AVL), are tasked with thwarting the plans of Balthazar Bratt, a former child star turned villain. After failing to secure Bratt and the stolen Dumont Diamond, they are unceremoniously fired from the AVL. Their personal lives are upended when most of their Minions leave, and Gru discovers he has a twin brother, Dru, who lives in wealth and wishes to become a villain like their father. As Gru grapples with his identity and reluctance to return to villainy, Bratt steals the diamond again to execute his revenge on Hollywood. The brothers eventually team up to stop Bratt, leading to a series of misadventures that test their bond, culminate in a dramatic rescue mission, and finally, bring the family closer together. Despite initial tensions and conflicts, the story ends on a high note with Gru and Lucy’s reinstatement into the AVL and a renewed sense of unity among the characters, setting the stage for further adventures. * * * Illuminat… (CHUCKLES) (CLEARS THROAT) Illuminat… (GIGGLES) Illuminat… (SPEAKING MINIONESE) (FARTS) (SNIFFS AND GROANS) (GIGGLES) Illumination! (FARTS) (GROANING) The year was 1985, and the number one show on TV was… Evil Bratt! HOST: The show starred young Balthazar Bratt as a child prodigy and criminal mastermind bent on world domination. (LAUGHING) There he is! Get him! (ALL GRUNTING) I’ve been a bad boy! Bratt was the biggest child actor of the 1980s, striking a chord with audiences all over the world. (BOTH CHEERING) (BALTHAZAR LAUGHING) There he is! Get him! HOST: But it all came to an end in Season 3, when… I’ve been a bad boy! HOST: The young star experienced an unexpected growth spurt. Boy? Ugh! The show was canceled. Hollywood rejected him and Bratt quickly plunged into a downward spiral, starting to actually believe he was the character he played on TV. What are you looking at? HOST: Leading us all to wonder, where is he now? (BALTHAZAR LAUGHING) (CHUCKLING) You know what, Clive? Playing a villain on TV was fun, but being one in real life is even better. Heist music! Here it comes. (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING) (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) What? Clive, what are you doing? How is that heist music? Sorry. My bad. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Ew! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Mommy! Stop or I’ll… (GROANS) (ALARM BLARING) Sir, the ship has been boarded by some kind of monster! Wait! That’s not a monster. That’s a man wearing shoulder pads! There’s only one supervillain whose fashion sense is quite that dated. Balthazar Bratt. Blast it! The Dumont Diamond is on that ship. I want every agent in the area on the scene immediately! (MINIONS LAUGHING) We’re already here. Agents Grucy are closing fast. Yes! Wait. What did you call us? “Grucy.” You know, Gru and Lucy mushed together. Try it. Oh! I like it, but not a lot. I don’t like it. Stop! On the ground! (BOTH YELP AND GRUNT) (CHUCKLES) (AGENTS CLAMORING) Go, go, go! Eh? (ALL SCREAM) Too late again, Gru! (LAUGHS) Wha? He’s getting away! That’s what he thinks. (MINIONS WHOOPING) Go! Go! Go… Go! Go! Go! (GRUNTS) Go! Go! I don’t think we can make it, Gru! We can make it! We can make it! No, we can’t! Ahh! Get ready! Get ready for… (GRU AND MINIONS SCREAMING) Hey. How you doing? (GROANS) (COUGHING) (GIRL GASPS) GIRL: Are you okay? (SPEAKING MINIONESE) (CHUCKLES) You guys are so cute. Go get him, Gru-Gru! Hello, Gru. How’s your transition coming? You know, from world’s worst villain to world’s worst agent? Oh, that’s hilarious. You should be on TV. Oh, that’s right. You were! But then you got canceled! (CHUCKLES) Ha-ha! What about that? Ugh! What? Oh, girls! Oh! (GRUNTING) Dance fight! (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (SCATTING) Ow! (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) Alpha Team, the diamond is secure. Come and pick up the package. ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Copy that. Alpha Team in approach. Gru! Did you actually think I was unconscious? Huh! It’s called acting, hoser. And clearly, I’ve still got it! (SCREAMING) (PLAYING KEYTAR) (GRU CONTINUES SCREAMING) I’ve been a bad boy! (CACKLES) ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Freeze! Don’t move! Son of a Betamax! SOLDIER: Go, go! Get him! He’s getting away! (YELLING) This isn’t over, Gru. You hear me? This is no',\n",
       "  't over. Yeah? Well, I still have the diamond. (LAUGHS) ALL: (SINGING) Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to… Happy birthday, dear Dan Happy birthday to you (BOTH LAUGHING) (SPEAKING MINIONESE) (MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (PEOPLE YELPING) (GRU GROANING) I can’t believe Bratt got away again. How is this possible? How? (GRU LAUGHS) And it’s not just that he got away, it is he’s so smug about it. “Ooh, I’ve been a bad boy!” Gah! Edna, hey! Looking hot today. Got cats on you. And it was so humiliating, dangling there in the bubble-gum Speedo. And I didn’t have time to go to the gym this week, and I had a big breakfast. And was feeling a little bloated. You know what? He’s not even worth talking about. I don’t even want to waste another breath about the guy. And another thing! Next time I see Bratt, I will moonwalk all over his stupid face! (MIMICS DANCING) Thank you all for coming at such short notice. It is with great sadness that I inform you that, as of today, I am retiring as head of the AVL. (ALL GASP) Oh, no! Your new leader is coming directly from head office. Effective immediately. She is the very gifted, very ambitious, Miss Valerie da Vinci. As I look out over all your faces, I am flooded with so many memories. Oh, boy! This is a snooze fest! Excuse me, this is my last… Blah, blah, blah! We understand. You’re old, you’re fat, you’re done. Let me breathe in. (GRUNTING) (SILAS GROANS) (ALL GASP) Ooh, broke a little sweat, there. (CHUCKLES) First order of business, (CLEARS THROAT) which one of you losers is Agent Gru? Oh, that would be me. Although, I don’t know if I’d say “loser,” per Se. Kind of is… (GASPS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) (GRUNTS) Oh, it’s the girls! Not a good time. Hey! Ahh! Yes, sir! (GASPS) Uh… Ma’am? You’re making me nervous. How could you let Balthazar Bratt, the AVL’s most wanted villain, just get away? That is the opposite of what we do here! Okay, okay. Yes, maybe he got away. Again. But he didn’t get the diamond. And I am this close to bringing him in. This close. Huh. Interesting. You’re fired! (GASPS) What? That’s totally not fair. Gru is a great agent! You know what? If you fire him, you’re gonna have to fire me, sister-sister. And do you really wanna do that? Do ya? GRU: No, no, no! (BOTH SCREAMING) (GRU GRUNTING) Well, I guess she did. Honey, you didn’t have to do that. I know how much you love your job. Well, I love other things more. You know, we’re gonna have to tell the girls. Can you do it? The whole “mom” thing is still kind of new to me. Oh, sure. Huh? Psst! (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) (BOTH YELLING) Hello? (ALL CRYING OUT) (GIRLS CHUCKLING) GIRLS: Aloha! LUCY: Oh! This is unexpected. Well, you never got to go on a honeymoon, so… We made you dinner! It’s a luau! We got pineapples and coconuts and ukuleles! Oh! Yay! Yay! (SINGING IN MINIONESE) (CLEARS THROAT) The soup of the day. Madame and Monsieur. The gummy bears were my idea. Mmm! Looks too good to even eat. Am I right? (CHUCKLES) But I made it for you. Oh. (MUFFLED GROAN) Mmm-mmm-mmm! Good soup! I love the combination of gummy bears and meat. (SPUTTERS) I’m gonna hold it in my mouth. ‘Cause it’s so good, I don’t wanna swallow it. So, how was work? Ooh, did you take that guy down? Did anything explode? Well, actually, today, Lucy and I were invited to not work at the AVL anymore. (UKULELE STRING SNAPS) (GASPS) No! You got fired? Oh, no! No, no, no. (LAUGHS) Yes. (GIRLS GASP) But don’t worry. I’m sure we’ll get new jobs. Real soon. Even better ones. (SCOFFS) What’s better than being super-cool secret agents? Ooh, I know! You could gamble online! That’s what Katie’s dad does. Okay. We will definitely look into that. That’s a good suggestion. And let’s not go over to Katie’s house anymore. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hmm? (GRU GRUNTS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) GRU: Guys! Shh! I don’t think you heard me right. No, no, no. This does not mean that we are going back to being villains. (MINIONS GROAN) (GRUNTS AND SPEAKS MINIONESE) Okay, all right. I get it. Look, I know it’s been a little tough lately. Especially with Dr. Nefario accidentally freezing himself in carbonite.

We’re not going back to villainy. (SPEAKING MINIONESE) Yes! And I don’t want to hear another word about it.

You’re serious? Come on! (GRUNTING) (CHUCKLING) Dave! Jerry! (CHUCKLING) Great news, guys. You have been promoted. You’re in charge now. Huh? Not bad. (BOTH LAUGH) (SPEAKING MINIONESE) (SIGHS LOUDLY) Jeesh! (GUARD GASPS) (GRUNTS) Ah, Monsieur Pompeux! To what do we owe the presence of the world’s foremost gem expert? The chief of police sent me. He was concerned that during the recent heist attempt, the Dumont Diamond was replaced with a phony. (ALL GASP) (SNIFFING) Ooh, la-la! You have been duped! (GASPS) What? We have? Yes. By me!

Oh, yes. Yeah, I’m fine. I’m fine. It’s just… (SIGHS) I don’t know. I guess I just feel like a failure. Like I don’t have a purpose anymore. Hey, mister, you are not a failure. If only I could have nailed Bratt. So many times, I almost had him. But now I’ll never get the chance, ’cause I have been kicked to the curb. Gru, you’ve got to let this go. It’s time to look forward. Things will get better. I promise. (GRU SIGHS) (SPEAKING MINIONESE) Excuse me. Pardon me, young people? Would you tell me how to get to this address? (STAMMERING) (SPEAKING MINIONESE) I’m looking for a Mr. Gru. (SPEAKING MINIONESE) (BLOWING RASPBERRY) (ALL CHATTERING IN MINIONESE) (GRUNTING) Idiots. (GROWLING) GRU: No! Kyle! Stop! Kyle, let go!

So (SNIFFLES) take good care of him. Thank you! (CHUCKLES) Agnes, what are you doing? You sold your unicorn? Well, I just wanted to help, since you don’t have a job. I got two whole dollars for it.

Yeah, but… (SIGHS) Hey, could you… Oh, uh, of course. Now, as I was saying, I… Uh… Oh. Goodbye! (SQUEALS) (CHUCKLES) Listen, Agnes, you don’t need to worry. We’re going to be fine. For real? For real. Now, come on, let’s pack this stuff up. FRITZ: Ow! Ow! Seriously? Buddy, you’re not getting the hint. Excuse me, Mr. Gru, but I really must have a word with you. How do you know my name? Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fritz. (KYLE BITES) Ow! (GROANING) (GROWLING) Good puppy. And I am inquiring on behalf of your twin brother, Dru. He needs your help. What? Twin brother? Twin brother? (SPEAKING MINIONESE) Oh, ja. He would like to fly you to Freedonia to meet him. Your father has recently passed away and… (LAUGHS) Okay, cuckoo. I’m sorry, but my dad died when I was a baby, and I don’t have any brother. You got the wrong guy. Really? Well, then, how do you explain this? (GRU STAMMERS) (MAN HUMMING) VINCENZO: (CHUCKLING) Bellissimo! (GRU’S MOM LAUGHING) Oh, hello, Gru. Hi, Mom. It’s important to keep active in one’s golden years. (CHUCKLES) Oh!

We each took one son to raise on our own and promised never to see each other again. Obviously, (CHUCKLING) I got second pick. I have a brother! Hey, girls! How are things in Row B, huh? I put together some fun activities for the trip! Who is up for some gin rummy? Yeah, um… We’re good. Oh, okay. I’ll just sit here and play solitaire. I hope I win. I wonder what Dru will be like. Ooh! Maybe we’ll have the twin thing when you can read each other’s minds, no? How cool would that be? Um, super cool! (CHUCKLES) (MINION LAUGHING) (SIGHS) Ooh!

We’re gonna have to make a little trouble later. I already have! (LAUGHS) Ow! Ow! Please! Why are you doing that? Ow! Fist bump for mischievous behavior! And Margo. Oh, you are so mature! I’m guessing… Mmm… 15? 15? She’s 12. She looks 12 and will always be 12. So, Dru, this place is amazing! I mean, you just walk through the doors and you’re like… (GRUNTS AND LAUGHS) Oh, it’s nice, I guess, sure. I’m not really into things. MARGO: This is so cool! AGNES: Look at that! EDITH: Oh, my gosh!

Featuring music-activated breakdance mode. Also featuring bubblegum-launching shoulder pads! And the all-new Mega Diamond Laser! No more math! I’ve been a bad boy! (LAUGHS) ANNOUNCER: The Mega Diamond Laser does not actually incinerate books. (SIGHS) How could Hollywood cancel a show that produced toys like this, Clive? Evil Bratt was a masterpiece! Does no one value true art anymore? It’s a disgrace and a travesty, sir. Well, now that I’ve got the diamond, it’s payback time. Oh, it’s too bad Gru won’t be around to try and stop me. Oh, wait! No, it’s not. I hate that dweeb! And you, Hollywood! This time, I’m canceling you and all the losers who rejected me! (EVIL LAUGHTER) Oh, piggy, piggy! So, how are things going for you career-wise?

He was known as the Bald Terror! That’s him? Our dad? He was so proud of you. And what a great villain you were. (GASPS) He was? But me, eh, not so much. To Dad, I was just a failure. He never thought I had what it took to be a villain. But now, you can help me prove him wrong! Brother, teach me the art of villainy! No. No, no, no. I can’t do that. What? (STUTTERING) But it’s our family tradition! You can’t say no to that! Look, I’m sorry. I left that life behind me. End of story. Oh. Okay. I understand. Hmm! I wonder what this does.

Well, it’s okay to tell them no sometimes, too, you know? Moms need to be tough. Right, right. Tough. Good one. I can totally do that. You know, still figuring out this mom thing. Gettin’ my sea legs, matey! (AGNES SCREAMS) It’s a unicorn! Can we go in there? Please, please, please! (MEN GROANING) Um… Sure! Yeah! You know, but first let’s… Um… (GASPS) Oh, look!

Go take a bite of his cheese, young lady. Right now! What? I’m being tougher, you know? Like you said. No! I meant be tougher on them. Not me! Oh, come on, just do it.

The only place on earth where unicorns still live. (ALL PATRONS LAUGH) Huh! (SPITS) Laugh, laugh, all of you. (MIMICS LAUGHING) They all think I’m crazy. But I’m telling you, I saw one once. With my own eye. Wait, wait, wait. You saw a for-real live unicorn? What did it look like? (GASPS) Did you pet it? Did it smell like candy? Was it fluffy? It was so fluffy, (SIGHS) I thought I was gonna die. Mmm! Do you think maybe I could find one, too? Oh!

And he’ll use his magical powers to help me do math. Amen. (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) Oh, hi, Gru. Hey. So, big day tomorrow. Yeah, I’m finally gonna get to see a unicorn. For reals. (GASPS) If I do, can I bring it home? Please? Oh, yeah. Sure. Tell you what, every unicorn you find, you can bring it home. I’d better build a big pen, right? But, you know, there’s a chance that you might not find one. Huh? (STAMMERING) It might not be good unicorn-finding weather. Um… They’re tricky to find them. And I don’t know. Maybe… Maybe unicorns don’t really explore that part of the woods. (CHUCKLES) (SNIFFLES) But the man said a maiden could find one if she was pure in heart. And I’m pure in heart, right? The purest.

AGNES: Unicorns, here we come. What’s that for? Bait! Duh. Come on! (YELPS) Now, all we have to do is wait. Okay, this is Bratt’s lair.

This is not like stealing lollipops. Whoa! His security system can detect an air assault from any direction. (SCREAMING) Ouch! No! Ouch! Please, stop! Ouch!

She take over when she’s ready. And speaking of ready',\n",

I mean, she’ll probably never do deliveries as quick as me. You don’t think that I can beat your record? Because I have been taking it easy on you, so I don’t hurt… (TIMER CLICKS) …your feelings, Mr. Smokestack. (PATRONS LAUGHING) But game on. CINDER: Before I see if you are a match, I splash this on your heart to bring love to the surface. (BOTH GRUNT) And I will read the smoke. (SOOTHING NEWAGE MUSIC PLAYING) (SNIFFING) (WOMAN GASPS) Ember, I’m doing a reading. Sorry, got to grab some stuff. Going for Dad’s record. So, are we a match? It’s true love. (BOTH SIGH IN RELIEF) Which is more than I ever smelled on this one. Oh, goody, this old chestnut. (GRUNTS) (SNIFFING) Yep. Nothing. Just a loveless, sad future of sadness. Ember, work with me. (SIGHS) Your finding match was my mother’s dying wish. Promise me one thing, marry Fire. (GROANS) (CRACKLES) Nice try, Mom. Got to go. (COUPLE KISSING NOISILY) Save it for the wedding. Hey. (PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYS) Yo, yo, yo, Ember. Yo, Clod. Can’t talk, in a hurry. And don’t let my dad catch you out here again. What? Come on, he doesn’t like my landscaping? (GROANS) Anyway, June Bloom is coming and you just got to be my date ’cause check it out. I’m all grown up. (SNIFFS) And I smell good. Ow. My queen. Sorry, buddy, elements don’t mix.

(TRAIN HORN BLOWS) (CLOD MOANS HAPPILY) EMBER: Plus, the city isn’t made with Fire people in mind. Sorry, but it’d take an act of God to get me across that bridge. An act of God?

Still have much to prepare for Red Dot Sale. Dad, I’ll take care of it. You need to rest. (TIMER RINGING) (DINGS) How? I learned from the best. (BOTH LAUGH) (COUGHS) (SIGHS) I am old. I can’t do this forever. Now that you’ve beaten my time, there’s only one thing you haven’t done. Tomorrow I sleep in and I want you to run shop for Red Dot Sale. Seriously? By myself? If you can do that without losing your temper, it will show me you are able to take over. You got it, Àshfá. I won’t let you down, I swear. You’ll see. BERNIE: Mm. Good daughter. Yes! (SQUEALS, GIGGLES) Blue Flame, please, let this go my way. (VEHICLE PUTTERING) (HORN HONKS) WOMAN: Good morning! MAN: Morning! EMBER: Take a breath. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Calm as a candle.

(SOBS) Who are you? What are you doing here? I don’t know. I was searching for a leak on the other side of the river and got sucked in. This is bad, I can’t lose another job. I just can’t seem to find my flow. (BUBBLING) Dang! (GROANS) That pipe squished me all out of shape. (GURGLES) That’s better. Dude, just get out of here. I gotta clean this mess before my dad sees what I did. Ooh… Actually… I’m afraid I’m gonna have to write you a ticket. A ticket? Yeah. I’m a city inspector, and this pipe is definitely not up to code. I sucked a city inspector into our pipes? I know. Ironic, right? (CLANKING) Stop messing with that. Well, I need to make sure it’s solid. Everything’s solid. I should know. My dad rebuilt this place himself. Wait, your dad did? Yes, with his bare hands, every brick and board. It was a ruin when he found it. Wow. He did all of this himself? Without permits? Uh… (GULPS) I’m gonna have to write that up too. First, I’m sucked into a pipe and now I have to write citations that could get this place shut down. Oh, gosh. It’s just too much. Shut us ',\n",
       "  'down? I know, it’s awful. No, you can’t shut us down, please. This is a big day for me. It’s our Red Dot Sale. Hey, take it easy. This is as hard on me as it is on you. Get back here.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. Please… No. (GROANS) You don’t understand. Whoa. EMBER: This shop is my dad’s dream. If I’m the reason it gets shut down, it will kill him. Oh. He will never trust me to take over. Why didn’t you say that before? (CLEARS THROAT) Wait, does that mean you’ll tear up the tickets? I mean, I would, but I just sent them over to the processing department. (GROANS FRUSTRATEDLY) But I can take you there so you can plead your case. (TUBES WHOOSHING) (GRUNTS) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (ANIMALS TRILLING) Whoa! CITY INSPECTOR: Hey, Fern. (CHUCKLES) How you doing? (DULLY) Living the dream. (CHUCKLES) You know those citations I just gave you from Firetown? I was about to send them to Mrs. Cumulus. Then get sprayed for fungus rot. BOTH: Wait. Tell him what you told me about your dad and letting him down. No. That’s personal. It really got to me. He might feel it too. Her dad will be sup… Nope. …sup… Nope. …super disappointed in her. Stop it. He might even be… (GROANS) ashamed. What are you doing? But the main thing is, if her father can’t retire… (HUFFING RAPIDLY) …it will be all Ember’s f… Stop talking! (WATER BUBBLES) (DESK CREAKS) Looks like I’m going home early today. No, don’t. (TUBE WARBLES) Expect to get shut down within a week. Have a good one. (GROANS) Sorry. (SIGHS) (GASPS) What? (BELL JINGLES) Already? Hello? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (BERNIE COUGHING) (GASPS) (CONTINUES COUGHING) Oh, no. Dad, what happened? We lucky nobody hurt. It ruined Red Dot Sale. Did he do this? Who? The Water guy I see you chase. (GROANS) Oh, uh… Um… Yeah, he did. Uh… He just broke through a pipe. (CLEARS THROAT) I don’t know why. Luckily, I was able to close it off. I, uh, couldn’t catch him though. Water, always trying to water us down. He was a Water person, Dad, not just water. Ah, same thing. And why is water in pipes? City shut down years ago. There should be no water. (COUGHS) Dad! Bernie. We will get through this. Just like before. Before? There is a reason we left Fire Land. Oh, Ember, we loved it there so much. Most everyone had a Blue Flame. And it connected us all together. To our traditions. Our family. It was hard living. But your father began to build a life for us. We put everything into it. (WIND HOWLING) But then a great storm came. (CRASHING) (SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING) All was lost for us. Your father understood we had to leave everything. Our home. It was the only way to create a better life. It was the last time your father ever saw his family. That is why we came here. To build all this. Àshfá, nothing will happen to this shop or the flame again, I promise. Mm. Good daughter. (HIPHOP SONG PLAYING ON HEADPHONES) (FIRE ROARS SOFTLY) (YELPS) Fire! Fire! Ah! Fire! Hey, hey! Oh, sorry. You’re so hot. (BLOWS) Excuse me? No, I mean, like, you’re smoking. No, I didn’t mean it like that. Are you done yet? Yes, please. I’m waiting to talk to your boss. So, make like a stream and flow somewhere else. Actually, Gale won’t be in today. She’s a huge airball fan and the Windbreakers are finally in the playoffs. Toot toot. (GROANS) Okay. Well, I just came by because I left my passes for the game here last night. Passes? Like, plural? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (GASPS) (FANS CHANTING) (KERNKRAFT 400 (SPORT CHANT STADIUM REMIX) PLAYING) (PLAYER GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (SPECTATORS GROAN) Where is she? Up there, in that skybox. Come on!

       "  'e, what do you think? Blow the ball, not the game! (LIGHTNING CRACKLES) (HUFFS) Yeah, so, uh, Gale. (CHUCKLES) My name is Ember Lumen. My family runs a Fire shop. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Wade wrote us a bunch of tickets yesterday… What kind of call was that? (SPECTATORS GROAN) Oh, Lumen? Yeah, a Fire shop with 30 citations. Thirty? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Anyway, friend, I was hoping we could work something out. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Come on, ref! Are your eyes in the back of your head? (SPECTATORS BOOING) (GRUNTS, GROWLS) Oh, no. Yeah, bummer. Oh, yeah. Okay, so, the 30 citations. Do you mind? There’s a game going on. Fireball. Fireball? Actually, I do mind. This is my life we’re talking about. Not just some game. Some game? This is the playoffs. So, forgive me if I don’t want to hear a sob story about the problems of some little shop. Well, that little shop matters way more than a bunch of overpaid cloud puffs blowing some ball around. I dare you, say “cloud puffs” one more time. Cloud puffs. (BOTH GROWL) WADE: Oh, no! (SPECTATORS BOOING) Lutz! (BLOWS, GRUNTS) (SPECTATORS GROAN) (GASPS) (CHIMING) (SPECTATORS BOOING) Lutz, man. He’s been in such a funk ’cause his mom has been sick. (BOOING) That is so not cool, he’s doing his best. (LOUDLY) We love you, Lutz! (VOICE CRACKING) Lutz! We love you, Lutz! We love you, Lutz! Come on! We love you, Lutz! Everybody!

(KERNKRAFT 400 (SPORT CHANT STADIUM REMIX) PLAYING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (CHEERING) Yay! Yeah! Way to go, Lutz! (BLOWS) WADE: Yeah, Lutz! That was amazing, Lutz! (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTS) Yeah! Yeah! Yes! (CHUCKLES) Whoohoo! Oh. Whoohoo! What a comeback. Check out who found the gift shop. Whoo! I gotta admit, that was pretty cool. You can see why I can get all churned up, but as a cloud puff who used to come here with her dad, all these wins mean a little bit more. And as a fireball who’s supposed to take over her dad’s shop, I sure don’t want to let him down, and I could use a win, too. Now, I just got to stop water from coming in. Water? In Firetown? Yeah. Water was shut off to there years ago. Oh, forget the tickets, I’m gonna have to take apart your dad’s shop to figure out what’s going on. You can’t! My dad put his whole life into that place. (GRUNTS) I bet this is connected to that fluffing leak. Yeah, we’ve been trying to track down a leak in the city. It’s why I was in the canal and… Wait, I know where I got sucked into Ember’s shop. Ember and I could track the water from her shop to find the source of the leak. Keep talking. I could call in a city crew to fix whatever we find. Yes. And there’d be no need to touch my dad’s shop. You’re lucky you’re a cute couple. Oh, we’re not a… You got until Friday. If you can find the leak and get a crew to fix it by then, those tickets are forgiven. If not, your dad’s shop gets shut down. Whoohoo! Break wind! Break wind! Thank you. (SIGHS IN RELIEF, CHUCKLES) Please take all that off. But I got you a hat. (BOOM) Okay. EMBER: Just keep out of sight, okay? It’d be a whole thing. BERNIE: Now water upstairs? It’s in the walls. I don’t understand. I fix one pipe and another one leaks. (GROANS) Water! (COUGHING) How could it be worse? Now that the water’s back, the pressure is forcing it up to all your pipes. We gotta find the source. How did you even end up here? WADE: Well, I was in the canals checking the doors for leaks, when I found some water that shouldn’t have been there. Rusty with a hint of motor oil? There was this whoosh of water. (SCREAMS) And I got sucked into a filtering system. Help! (GRUNTS) But then I heard this explosion. (RUMBLING) (EMBER SCREAMING) (WADE SCREAMS) That’s how I ended up at your place. Oh, flame! My temper caused this. So, we’re searching for water somewhere in a canal? Those canals go everywhere. It’s why tracking down that leak has been so dang hard. The roof. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (YELPS) (GRUNTS) You might want to step back. (GRUNTS) (CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING) Holy dew drop! Shh. Get in. (WADE GRUNTS) (FIRE ROARS) (CAPTIVATING MUSIC CONTINUES) (WATER BUBBLING) (STEAM HISSING) Okay, that’s where I got sucked in. More water. Go that way. (CHUCKLING) Yeah, right there. Mm. (LAUGHS) Oh! (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Nothing weird going on here. (IN SINGSONG) Uh, just a little pruning. (BOTH LAUGHING) (EMBER SNIFFS) So, uh, what do you do at the shop? If you don’t mind me asking. EMBER: My dad’s retiring and I’ll be taking over. Someday. When I’m ready. (SIGHS) WADE: It must be nice knowing what you’re gonna do. After my dad passed, I got all, “What’s the point?” Now I just go from one job to the next. There’s a word in Firish. (SPEAKING FIRISH) Tìshók. It means embrace the light while it burns because it won’t always last forever. (HALTINGLY) Teeshook. Or something like that. (CHUCKLES) You okay? Yeah. You sure? It’s just, that building over there, that’s Garden Central Station. When I was a kid, my dad took me there because they had a Vivisteria tree. I’d always wanted to see one. It’s the only flower tha',\n",
       "  't can thrive in any environment. Fire included. I was so excited. But they said our fire was too dangerous, and they wouldn’t let us in. (SHOUTS IN FIRISH) Go back to Fire Land. EMBER: My dad was so angry… Burn somewhere else! Get outta here! EMBER: …and embarrassed. The building flooded a few years later. So, I missed my one chance to see a Vivisteria. You must have been so scared. I was. (GROANS) How do you do that? Do what? Draw people in? You got a whole stadium to connect with you. I… I can’t even connect with one customer. My stupid temper always kicks in. I guess I just say what I feel. And I don’t think a temper is so bad. Sometimes when I lose my temper, I think it’s just me trying to tell me something I’m not ready to hear. That’s ridiculous. Maybe. Hey, there. Put us down there. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) That’s not right. (SMACKS LIPS) Motor oil. Yup, this is the source. Why is there no water? Because the doors are broken. This is supposed to catch spill over from those main canals and… (SHIP HORN BLOWS) Run for your life! (WADE GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) Help! (SCREAMING) (WATER RUMBLING) Uh… (GRUNTS) Grab this! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (WADE GRUNTS) (PANTING) (TENSE MUSIC PLAYING) EMBER: Firetown. Catch! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Ember, throw me more! (BOTH GRUNTING) (SIGHS) Whew. So, will this hold? (GRUNTS) Yup. It should for sure. At least long enough for me to get a city crew to fix it before Friday. What? You’ve got a little (CHUCKLES) sand. Oh. Here? Here? It’s right there. Um… Oh. (BUBBLES) Thanks. Well, let me know when it’s done, I guess. I’ll make sure there’s a city crew here by Friday. Okay. See ya. Wait. Any chance you’re free tomorrow? (NERVOUSLY) To hang out with a Water guy? With a Water guy? My dad would boil you alive. He doesn’t have to know. We can meet in the city. I promise, nothing weird. Maybe a little pruning? (CHUCKLES) Sorry, that’s not going to happen. You smiled. I saw it. Tomorrow, I’ll be at the Alkali Theater. 3:00! Yeah because then you know with the light… Oh! Your ceiling is dripping again. More leaks? Don’t worry. This whole problem is going away. I can feel it. (GASPS) And since we’re all good, I am also going away to do deliveries. (SNIFFS) Do I smell something on Ember? (CHUCKLES EXCITEDLY) (BELL JINGLES) CLOD: Yo, Ember. (SHOUTS IN SURPRISE) Clod. CLOD: I grew another one. (GRUNTING) Ow. (FLOWER PINGS) My queen. (EXPLODES, SIZZLES) Oops, sorry, but gotta go.

I’d forgotten a tiny detail about the last time I saw that city crew. You knocked over three tons of cement dust. Half the guys still haven’t recovered. (ALL GRUNT ANGRILY) I guess you could say they still have hard feelings (CHUCKLES) because they won’t help us. Wade, Gale’s deadline is tomorrow. We need more sandbags. But that didn’t work before. Well, I can’t just do nothing. Ember, did you fix leak? (GASPS) It’s you again. Who? Me? You’re the guy who started all this. (YELPS) No, Dad. Different guy. Not all Water looks alike. You are city inspector? Uh… EMBER: No. Right? (EMBER CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Right! I am not an inspector. (BUBBLING) You are inspector. Why you poking around? Is this because of water leak?

(BERNIE SIGHS IN ANGER) (EXCLAIMS IN FIRISH) Dad, don’t worry. I’ve got this. (SPEAKING FIRISH) Look, meet me at the beach and we’ll make more sandbags. We have to figure out how to fix those doors.

(EMBER GRUNTS) WADE: I don’t think this is going to work. Well, it won’t unless you hold the bag straight. Maybe your dad will understand. (SCOFFS) I’m serious. Look, I know it can be tough. I mean, with my dad, we were like oil and water. I never got a chance to fix that. But you guys are different. It might be time to tell him. Yeah, right. And tell him what? That I got us shut down and destroyed his dream? (SHOUTS IN FRUSTRATION) (PANTING) (SIGHS) I think I’m failing. My Àshfá should have retired years ago, but he doesn’t think I’m ready. You have no idea how hard they’ve worked. Or what they’ve had to endure. Family they left behind. How do you repay a sacrifice that big? It all feels like a burden. How can I say that?

I understand. (CINDER GRUNTING) You’re surprisingly good at your job. You’re surprisingly fast for your age. You have no idea. (WIND HOWLS) Ember! Oh, I’m so excited to finally meet you. Do we hug, or wave, or…? Don’t want to put you out. (CHUCKLES) Um, a hello is fine. Hardly. Wade hasn’t stopped talking about you since the day you met. The boy is smitten. Mom. Oh, come on. I’m your mother. I know when something’s lighting you up. I just didn’t know she’d be so smoky. (FAKECOUGHS) (BOTH LAUGHING) (EMBER LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY) Come this way, meet the rest of the family. (GASPS) (MELLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (WATER LAPPING) Hmm. Oh. Oh, honey, you won’t believe what your baby niece did today. She… She smiled. No, she didn’t. ',\n",
       "  '(BOTH SOBBING) WADE’S MOM: Yeah. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey, everyone, this is Ember. Hey! That’s my brother Alan and his wife Eddy. Hi. And we got two kids that are swimmin’ around here somewhere. Marco! Polo! What? (BOTH LAUGHING) Hi, Uncle Wade! Do you die if you fall in water? Whoa! Marco! Kids, (CHUCKLES) right? (MARCO GRUNTS) Don’t hate us. Anyway, that’s my little sib, Lake, and her girlfriend, Ghibli. GHIBLI: ‘Sup! They’re students at Element City School for the Arts. Yeah. Following in Mom’s wake. Oh, nonsense. I’m just an architect. The real artist is my brother, Harold. Oh, I just dabble in watercolors. Or as we like to call them, “colors.” Oh, don’t listen to him. He’s a wonderful painter. One of his paintings just got in the Element City Museum’s permanent collection. Wow, that is so cool. My only talent is “Clean up on aisle four.” (CHUCKLES) Talk about being modest. Ember’s got an incredible creative flame. I’ve never seen anything like it. I just have to say that you speak so well and clear. (CHUCKLES FORCEDLY) Yeah, it’s amazing what talking in the same language your entire life can do. Oh! Uh, hey, Ember, did, uh, Wadey here ever tell you that he’s deathly afraid of sponges? No. WADE: I was traumatized. Huh? Huh. (SCREAMS) (ALL LAUGHING) I still can’t use a sponge around him. I was stuck in there for hours. (LAUGHS) Oh. Alan! That was new. ALAN: My bad. I’m all whirlpools tonight. I can fix it. (INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING) (SQUELCHING) (INHALES DEEPLY, BLOWS) Oh, um… Sorry. That was incredible! (ALL EXCLAIM) It’s just melted glass. Just melted glass? Every building in the new city is built from just melted glass. Oh, no, you have to do something with that talent. See, I told you, you’re special. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BUBBLING) (GASPS) Ooh, thought bubble. Maybe after dinner we play The Crying Game? (CLAMORING) Yes, yes, yes. Let me guess, you try to cry? We try not to cry. You have one minute. Go! 1979. November. You were… (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS) (BAWLING) (CHEERING) (GROANING) Never got a chance to say goodbye to Nana. (CONTINUES BAWLING) Damn, you’re good. Okay, Ember, Wade, you’re up. Yeah, this is almost unfair because I have literally never cried. You got no chance. Sounds like a challenge. Ready, go! (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYS) Butterfly, windshield wipers, half a butterfly. (BOTH SNIFFLING) (SOBS) Okay. An old man on his deathbed remembers the summer he fell in love. She was out of his league and he was young and scared. (SNIFFLES) He let her go, thinking surely summer would come again. (SNIFFLING) It never did. Almost out of time. Ember, when I met you, I thought I was drowning. But that light, that light inside you has made me feel so alive. And all I want now is to be near it. Near you. Together. (DREAMY NEWAGE MUSIC PLAYING) (WHOOSHES) (SIZZLES) ALL: Aw. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Gale, hi. Glass? You repaired it with glass? Hold the storm. Hey! (GRUNTS) (CLANKS) Tempered glass. Solid as a rock, I like it. Consider the tickets cancelled. We did it? Yup! (BOTH LAUGHING) Awesome! Whoo! Oh. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Oh. Um… (LAUGHS) (WADE GROANS) Thank you, Mrs. Ripple. This was… This was really great. Yeah, it was. And I mean what I said about your talent. I have a friend who runs the best glassmaking firm in the world. During dinner, I slipped out and I made a call and I told her about you. They’re looking for an intern. It could be an amazing opportunity. For real? It’s a long way from the city, but it would be an incredible start. You have a bright future. Look at me, I have an original Ember. (CHUCKLES) Hold up, I’ll walk you out. (BREATHLESSLY) I’m afraid you’re going to have to wait out here, ma’am. And I’m afraid… (PANTING) I will throw up. (CINDER GROANS) (GROANS) (BURBLES) WADE: Ember. Ember, hold up, what’s going on? I can’t believe she basically offered me a job. I know! Could be cool. Yeah, super cool, Wade. I could move out and make glass in a faraway city. Do whatever I want. I don’t understand. I’m going home. Fine, then I’m going with you. (EMBER GROANS) (TIRES SCREECH) (PEOPLE YELP) A Water guy? (MIDTEMPO MUSIC PLAYING) (BIKE ACCELERATING) Look, my mom was just trying to be helpful. She doesn’t know how excited you are to run the shop. (SHOUTS IN FRUSTRATION) What is the matter? Nothing! Yeah? ‘Cause we’re going, like, a thousand… Bus! (TIRES SCREECH) (WADE YELPS) You don’t know me, Wade. Okay? So stop pretending like you do. What is this about? Nothing. Everything. I don’t know. It’s… (CLICKS) (TIRES SCREECH) (EMBER PANTS) I don’t think I actually do want to run the shop. Okay? That’s what my temper has been trying to tell me. I’m trapped. (SIGHS) You know what’s crazy? Even when I was a kid, I would pray to the Blue Flame to be good enough to fill my father’s shoes someday because this place is his dream. But I never once asked… what I wanted to do. (SIGHS) I think that’s because deep down, I knew it didn’t matter. Because the only way to repay a sacrifice so big is by sacrificing your life too. CINDER: Ember! (GASPS) Don’t move. Oh, blaze! My mother. (CINDER PANTING) (FOOTSTEPS CLANKING ON STAIRS) Mom, it’s okay. He’s just a friend. Si… Si',\n",

If your father find out… Fire and Water cannot be together. I prove it. Come with me. I splash this on your heart to bring love to the surface. (SIZZLES) (GRUNTS) (SLURPS) Mmm! And then you must light these with your fire, and I read the smoke. (SNIFFS) (SIZZLES) (PLAYFUL MUSIC PLAYING) See, Ember? It cannot be. Actually… What are you doing?

I wake up and nobody upstairs. It was just me. (DOOR SHUTS) (WADE GRUNTS) I was doublechecking the locks. (CHUCKLES) And Mom came down and… Yes, and we, uh, began looking at this door. We don’t talk about this door enough. (WHISPERS) Pull it together. Well, since you’re awake, I was gonna tell you tomorrow, but I’m too excited to sleep. In two days, I retire. Ooh. (GASPS) Oh, Bernie. Two days? Yes. We’re going to throw big party. A grand reopening. That way I can tell whole world my daughter take over. (CINDER LAUGHING) And I have gift for you. I’ve had this for a while, but after our talk, I know now is the time. Before I give it to you, I need you to understand what it means to me. (SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING) When I left Fire Land, I gave my father the Bà Ksô… the big bow. It is the highest form of respect. But my father did not return the bow. Did not give me his blessing. He say, if we leave Fire Land, we will lose who we are. (CRYING) They never got to see all of this. They didn’t get to see that I never forgot we are Fire. This is burden I still carry. Ember, it is important that you know you have my blessing every day you come in here. So I have this made for you. Wow, Àshfá. It’s gonna be big, bright. Everyone’s gonna see this. “Ember’s Fireplace.” We unveil it at grand reopening. (LAUGHS BOISTEROUSLY) Come, Bernie. You need your rest. (BERNIE COUGHS) (SIGN BUZZING) (SNIFFS, CRYING) (SHIP HORN BLOWS) (CRACKING) Ember, so, what’d your mom say about our reading? Nothing. Look, I have a gift for you. And you came all the way here to give it to me? Wait, why are you giving me gifts? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on, I think I have something to show you. Just give me two seconds. And you’re gonna need a pair of boots. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Wade, what are we doing here? Just wait. Why do they even have these? Eh, who knows? (SIGN CLATTERS) Hey, it’s my favorite fireball. Hey, Gale. What’s going on? I know you think you have to end this, but that flooded tunnel, it goes to the main terminal. Okay. Do you still want to see a Vivisteria? Gale? (INHALES DEEPLY) (BLOWS) Wait, I’m supposed to get in there? The air should last… At least 20 minutes. They said you couldn’t go in there. Why does anyone get to tell you what you can do in your life? (SIGHS) (WATER BUBBLING) (GRUNTS FEROCIOUSLY) (SOOTHING NEWAGE MUSIC PLAYING) (BLOWING) (HUFFING RAPIDLY) (EMBER GRUNTS) Whoa.

(GIGGLING) It was inspiring. You were inspiring. (GENTLE NEWAGE MUSIC PLAYING) No. Wade, we… we can’t touch. Maybe we can. No. But can’t we just prove it? Prove what? Let’s see what happens, and if it’s a disaster, then we’ll know this would never work. But it actually could be a disaster. I could vaporize you.

I take over tomorrow. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. You don’t want that, you said so yourself. It doesn’t matter what I want. Of course it does. Listen. Listen. You’ve got an opportunity to do something you want with your life. “Want”? Yeah, that may work in your rich kid, “follow your heart” family, but getting to do what you want is a luxury and not for people like me. Why not? Just tell your father how you feel. This is too important. Maybe he’ll agree. (CHUCKLES SCORNFULLY) Yeah. Funny. And this whole time, I thought you were so strong, but turns out you’re just afraid. Don’t you dare judge me. You don’t know what it’s like to have parents who gave up everything for you. I’m Fire, Wade. I can’t be anything more tha',\n",

(SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) WADE: I thought of other reasons. Wade? (CROWD GASPING) Oh, boy. What are you doing here? You said me not understanding is the reason we can never work. But I thought of other reasons. A bunch of ’em. Like, number one, you’re Fire, I’m Water. I mean, come on, that’s crazy. Right? (WOMAN ASSENTS) Who is this? No idea. Number two, I’m crashing your party. Like, what kind of a jerk am I? A pretty big one. Right? Number three, I can’t eat your delicious foods.

There are a million reasons why this can’t work. A million nos. But there’s also one yes, we touched. (ALL GASP) And when we did, something happened to us, something impossible. We changed each other’s chemistry. BERNIE: Enough! What kind of food inspection is this? A food inspection of the heart, sir. Who are you? Just a guy who burst into your daughter’s life in a flooded old basement. So you are the one who burst the pipes? What? Not me. It was… You? You burst the pipe? I… Ember. Silence! No! Take the chance. Let your father know who you really are. Look, I had regrets when my dad died. But because of you, I learned to embrace the light while it burns. (SPEAKING FIRISH) Tìshók.

       " ['When Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) distinguishes himself as the postal academy’s worst student, he is stationed on a frozen island above the Arctic Circle, where the feuding locals hardly exchange words let alone letters. Jesper is about to give up when he finds an ally in local teacher Alva (Rashida Jones), and discovers Klaus (J.K. Simmons), a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys. These unlikely friendships return laughter to Smeerensburg, forging a new legacy of generous neighbors, magical lore and stockings hung by the chimney with care. An animated Christmas comedy directed by Despicable Me co-creator Sergio Pablos, Klaus co-stars Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman and JK Simmons. \\xa0 \\xa0 Letters. You don’t really write many these days, do you? But I bet there’s one you never forget. Send it off to a certain plump guy in a red suit and, provided you’ve kept your act together more or less, he’ll drop off a toy or two. And yet, no one seems to wonder how the whole thing got started in the first place. This is a story about letters, and it began… with this one. …74, 75, 76… 77, 78, 79, 80! Drill Sergeant, sir! All the way from the top! Dispatch for one of your cadets! It’s for him, sir. Cadet Johanssen! Mmm-mmm-mmm! Stop. Don’t tell me. Let me try to guess. I give up. Who are you? Sarge! Drill Sarge! Have a seat. Can I get you something to drink? An espresso? A cappuccino? Aren’t you supposed to be in equestrian training? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. No worries. I’ve got someone covering for me. Dispatch from the Postmaster General’s Office! What? Sarge, is that for real? Don’t tease me now. Here, hold these. Ah, well, I was expecting this a little bit sooner, but, yup, summoned to the dragon’s lair. Go ahead and cancel the Drill Sergeant’s espresso, actually. And, uh, here, why don’t you finish mine? I’m not gonna be needing it anymore…and I’m gonna take one last look around the old place so I can forget it. Mmm-hmm. Got it. All right, let’s go. Nine months. It’s been nine months since I used every ounce of my influence to get you into the Royal Postal Academy. Actually, nine months and six days, but who’s counting? What? No croutons? Oh, man, come on! Shall we take account of your progress then? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Definitely. Sergeant. Yes, sir! Sorting and filing: total failure. Carrier pigeon care and handling… abysmal performance. Transport of fragile merchandise… worst on record. Well, there you have it. But, hey, we gave it the old college try, didn’t we? Guess I’ll just go pack up and head home then. Too bad. Darn, oh, darn. Stay right where you are. No, Dad! You’re right. When will I grow up? When will I stop squandering all these opportunities, which you so kindly forced me into, and become my own man? I guess I must really hanker down and rethink my priorities. All wrapped up in my silk sheets with some caviar and a sherry… You still buy the same brand, right? You think I’m just going to watch you purposely fail and then let you waltz right back to a privileged life void of any purpose or meaning? Well, yeah. Where else would I… Congratulations. You are now a postman. Come again? You are to establish a working postal office in… Smeerensburg. You’ve got one year. What? A year? Where? Smeerensburg? What is… What’s happening right now? Dad? Six thousand letters will suffice. Stamped by your own hand. And listen carefully, Jesper. If you fail to get those letters, you’re cut off. No more fancy apartments, stagecoach, clothes, galas… All gone. You can look forward to a cozy spot in the gutter. But… Six thousand letters, one year. You can’t cheat, bribe or squirm your way out of this one. Dad! Come on! It’s me. Let’s talk about this, man. It’s your son, Jesper! Little Jespie! Remember, I… “Daddy, can I help you mail the letters? Can I help you put the medals in the letters and put them in a stamp with the…” W-w-wait! Do you know how long it took to press this uniform? I don’t either, but it took somebody hours. Hello? Burghard! Finally, a friendly face. Can you believe what they… Burghard, I’m not in the coach with you. Burghard? Sir, I’m all for discipline, but Smeerensburg? Isn’t that a bit excessive? That boy needs a wake-up call, Sergeant. And who knows? Someday he might even thank me for it. Thank you, Dad! This is really wonderful, Father. Thank you so much. This is great, Dad. Really, really great. Thanks, Dad! Thank you! ',\n",
       "  'I love this terrible coach ride. Thank you so much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank… You go back to the intersection. You make a left at the dead tree. You’re welcome. What? No. I’m not lost. Trust me, you are. Funny! Say, nice boat! Any chance you might actually get on it today? What was that? New postman. Smeerensburg. Which is on an island, which is surrounded by water, which I need a boat to get to, which you have. Are we starting to connect the dots? Is the weather always like this? Eh. We’re having a bit of a heat wave. Huh? There she is. Smeerensburg. Charming, huh? Why, you should see it in the spring. That’s when those grays really pop. What happened here? Oh! Uh, colorful local traditions. Quirky folklore. That kind of thing. All part of this quaint town’s vibrant culture. No, no! Why you… Oh, you rotten vermin! Where is everyone? Everyone? I thought there would be some sort of a reception. Oh! Right. Right, the reception. Of course, the reception. It’s good you reminded me. You just ring the bell over there and, uh… and then the reception will start. The bell? Yep. Give it a go. And they’ll come out. Why, they’ll have a band, hors d’oeuvres and, uh… and the key to the city. All that reception stuff. Really? Out here? Why, of course! Well, it’s not every day they get a brand-new postman from the big city. Huh? What’s happening? Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Ow, they’re biting! Ow, get off! Get off! Get off! Isn’t this nice? And you thought they forgot. Quick! Get me out of here! Uh… What’s going on out here? Why is everybody just standing around? Well! Look who’s finally throwing in the towel! Throwing in the… Us? Ha! That’s rich! Admit it! You weaseled out and rang the bell! An Ellingboe? Never! It was one of you critters! Don’t you dare raise your voice at me! Oh, there you go! You rang that bell! You know you rang… Oh! You chicken out, and now you want to pin it on us! Unbelievable! We were plowing the snow… Oh, whoa! Hey! Huh. What’ve you got there, children? Mine! Pumpkin, show Daddy what you found. Mine. This is no way to treat a person! Certainly not this person! Just one second. Let me just… A postman? Pfft. Give me a break. When will they learn? Hey! They’ve sent us another postman! All right. All right. You don’t know who I am, so I’m gonna let this one slide. Okay? But let’s just say I’m not really a postman. Well, I am, because it’s our family business. My father’s a… Don’t get me started, because it’s… Where were we? Oh, yeah. Bell, please! Life is too short to go into details, but… Come to the counter. I’ll be right out. All right, listen. Whoever’s there, I warn you, you do not want to mess with me. Okay? Holy mackerel! Oh, the smell! Fresh out of mackerel. Only herring and burbot today. Oh. Oh. Uniform, cold sweat, scared stiff, shaking in your boots. All right, I’m gonna just take a wild guess here. You are the latest mailman, and the ferryman tricked you into ringing the Battle Bell. The Battle Bell? What kind of a town has a Battle Bell? Can we open a window in here or something? I can’t pretend any… Welcome to Smeerensburg, home of the world’s finest feuds. Feuds? Grudges, bickering, the Krums versus the Ellingboes. So… are you gonna buy something, or are you just here to chitchat? Wait. Isn’t this a school? Shouldn’t there be children and a teacher? Oh! Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you! I knew I was forgetting something! Children! Thank you! You’re the teacher? Okay, here’s how it works. I sell fish, and then the person on the other side of the counter… That would be you. You buy… Holy moly! That’s you? What happened? What happened was… That’s… That came out wrong. I took a teaching job at a place where people don’t send their kids to school! Mingling with their sworn enemy’s spawn? Oh, no! We can’t have that! So, now I’m reduced to doing this so I can get some money and start fresh somewhere far, far away from here. Are you going to buy something? Herring’s on sale today. Ah! There you are. I wondered where you’d scurried off to! Morning, Miss. Alva. Mogens. Come on, sport! I saved the best for last! Home sweet home. Ow! What the… Mail that, postman! Now wait a minute, that’s completely… Go home, you loser! Oh, yeah? Well, if I’m a loser, then you’re a, uh… You’re too far. You’re gone. Well, lots of nice, natural light, rustic touches, central air and panoramic views. Perfect for animal lovers. Enjoy. Wait! Wait! This can’t be right! ',\n",
       "  'I… Oh, I get it. Did my father put you up to this? Good one. Ha ha. You got me. Okay, well, enough of that. Show me where I’m really staying. I’d like a hot bath and a look at the dinner menu. Here, let me help you out. You’re a postman in Smeerensburg, which is on an island cut off from the world, frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors, and this is home now. Are we starting to connect the dots? Aah! Ugh. Almost. Hang in there. What? Hmm? Oh. Aah! That’s it! This place is the worst! I’m going home! No! You can’t leave, remember? You’ll be broke! Out in the streets! But I hate it here! It’s so cold and icky! And the people are mean to me. And I miss my silk sheets. Shut up! Stop being weak! Focus! How do you get out of here? You need… You need… letters! Ugh. All right. This is a good one. I can feel it. Come to Papa, you sweet, sweet little… Oh, come on! Ugh! Pssh! Fine. Go to the source, I guess. Good morning, madame. I’m the postman, obviously. If you have letters you’d like me to send, you could go scurry ahead and get them and… Hello! Hi! Hi! If you have your letters on you, I’d be glad to take them off your… Hmph! Birthday cards? Distant cousin? Deceased notice? Holy mother! Any letters… or packages? Any packages? Come on, people! Letters! Letters! I don’t have all day! Okay, keep low. Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Oh, I guess that’s why they call it “snail mail.” All right. What’s going on here? Where are all the letters? Oh. Folks around here only have one thing to say to one another. Ah. And they’re getting their point across pretty well without mail. Wouldn’t you say? Wait, wait, wait. No letters? But how am I supposed to get out of… What the… Hello? Sir, can I get my drawing back? The wind blew it away. Please? Not now, kid. Can’t you see I’m busy trying to figure out how to get… Well, here’s a thought. I’m a postman, see? So I can’t give it to you, but I could mail it to you. How? Couldn’t be simpler! I just fold your pretty drawing, very beautiful by the way, put it in an envelope like this and then all that’s left is postage so I can put it in the mailbox for you. – Postage? – Yep. You just toss a penny over to me so I can stamp it, and we’re all ready to go. Couldn’t you just put it in? Aw. Tsk. I really, really would, but I can’t. It’s not a letter if it doesn’t have postage. See how it works? So what do you say? I get my letter, and you get your drawing. Win-win. You want your drawing, don’t you? – Um… – If you don’t, I’m gonna keep it. – Hmm. – I love it. I would keep it if I was you, so I would send this letter back to myself if I was you. Oh, hi, Papa! This nice man says he can mail my drawing back to me! – He’s lying. Children are liars. – Can you give him a penny? Oh, look at that. Wrong address. Silly me. These aren’t… You’re not the Spendlebergs. I’ll see you later. Thank you so much, and no need… Aah! The puppies! The puppies! Ah. And that must be the express mail. All right, Smeerensburg. You may have won this round, but if you think I’m giving up, think again. I’ll have my letters in no time, and then it’s bye-bye to you and your cold and your loons and your chickens! That’s right! You too! You’ll see. I give it a week. Two, tops. Is this a bad time? I can see you’re pretty swamped. Don’t you have… a job or something? Why, sure I do. I’m here to pick up all the outgoing mail. So, where is it? Now, you’re gonna have to help me with the heavier bags. Bad back, don’t you know. – Man, I hate you. – I know. So, uh, where is the mail, anyway? Where do you keep it? In a different room now or something? What about if I walk around the room, if I get close to the mail, you say “warmer”? And if I’m getting farther from the mail, you say “colder”? – And then… – What’s that? What? Oh, the woodsman’s cabin? Yeah, does someone live there? Well, sure. Yeah, you should definitely drop by. Nice fella. Loves visitors. Hello? I’m in your house or… whatever this place is. Anybody here? Ah, come on. Really? Of course. Of course this would happen. Great. I’m gonna kill that boatman. What? Toys? Ah, here we go. Now I can go home with the satisfaction of having accomplished absolutely… Aah! Aah! Aah! Yeehaw! That’s it! I’ve had it! Better alive in the gutter than hacked into pieces! No, thank you! Yah! Please don’t chop me up and scatter my parts in the woods! Where’s this? What? I don’t know. How would I… Wait. I do know. Keep going down this road, and you’ll ',\n",

You’re a postman, aren’t you? Oh, you want me to… No, but I… Sure thing. My pleasure. Nothing I’d love to do more than deliver what I’m fairly certain can only be a severed head of some kind. I mean, there’s no way that’s not a severed head. It’s gotta… I’m holding a head in my hand, but hey! Come on! Look, I’m… Ah! You’re right there! So quiet for a disproportionately… I mean, strapping, uh… statuesque. You have a kind of, um… What? In there? You must be kidding. No way. Absolutely not. I mean, first of all, I’d love to, of course, but, look, too bad about the fence. Rats. Oh, well. What are you gonna do? Are you… What’s happening right now? Hey, listen, please. Open this! Why are you doing this to me? Oh, no. Okay, you win. What do you want? Money? My dad’s got plenty of it. You can write him a ransom note. You can write, right? Oh, it doesn’t matter. I’ll write it for you. Ah! He’ll never know it’s me! I’ll make it sound like it’s from you! I’ll use monosyllabic words, man! Please! Please! Please! Just let me out of here! I’m gonna get… Why? Ow! Ow! Who’s there? Aah! Door, door, door. Locks! This has gotta move! Come on! Come on! Open up. Open up. Open up! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Keep it together! Keep it together! Aah! Where are they, boys? Don’t let ’em get away! Come on! Get ’em! Okay. I’ve done all you’ve asked. Can I please… Hmm. Has he? Ah! He’s here to finish the job! – Oh, no! – Mr. Postman? Are you in there? Go away! Go! Leave! He’ll hear you! We’d like to send these letters! What? What did you just say? Our cousin told us if we write a letter to Mr. Klaus, he’ll make us a toy. He also said to bring you a penny each. It’s not a letter if it doesn’t have postage, right? – Psst. Hey. Hey, you. – Hmm? You want a toy? Hey! Would you, uh… like a brand-new toy? Just write a letter to Mr. Klaus. And you put it in the envelope, write your name on it and bring a penny. Can’t forget the penny. These better sound sad. Do they sound sad? Okay, good job. All right. And now… for the tricky part. All right. Remember… probably not an ax murderer, though… it still is a possibility, but most likely… no. He’s a good guy… deep down. Hello. Hello. Mr… Klaus, I take it? You remember me from the nice breaking and entering last night? Jesper Johanssen, postman, but we never properly… Uh… I, uh… You see, Mr. Klaus, it seems like word got around that the poor children of Smeerensburg have started, uh… completely unprompted… writing letters asking you for… toys. So I figured you have the whole barn filled with toys just sitting there collecting dust, so… Oh, God. Okay. This is it. Here it goes. Oh, wow. That is… totally normal. Not a symptom of any mental illness or anything. – Go away. – Mr. Klaus, sir! Those little children… …if you donate your old toys to them… …well, I’ll gladly deliver them for free! Mr. Klaus, wait! Please! Think of all the joy you’ll bring their miserable little lives! Look, here. Poor little Herlief. He only has sticks and stones to play with. So sad. And this one, little Penny… Patty. Her doll was so old, it crumbled in her arms when she came to me. And then Kristoff… Little, ugly Kristoff. This little… Tonight, same time. Great! What, “same time”? You mean, dead of night? – I can just take the toys now. – No. I go with you. There’s no need for you to come with me, really. It might be against the law for a noncertified postman to ride with me. I have to check the rule book. Great. Tonight, then. I’ll see you then. Good talk. Good talk. Whoa! Whoo! Huh? Oh, oh! Playing! Playing, I tell you. With an Ellingboe! – An Ellingboe, no less! – In all my years! – Did you all hear that? – Unacceptable. I don’t know how it happened. I turned away for one second… And then I saw it. I brought her as soon as I could, sir. – That’s just wrong! Wrong, I say! – Inconceivable! – What are we going to do? – Unthinkable! Hmm. This is bad. Very bad. Worst I’ve ever seen, really. What were you thinking, kid? Don’t you know that… Krums and Ellingboes don’t mix. – But why? – “Why?” he asks! – See what I mean? – Why? I don’t know what to do! Please help us, miss! I beg you! Do you know what this is, little boy? This is tradition! Centuries of gloriou',\n",
       "  's hatred, passed down through generations! There was the hundred-day brawl of ’45. Which we totally won! The maritime game of chicken. The Great Mooning of ’86. So, if there’s something we know… …going back as far as we can remember… …it’s that a Krum despises an Ellingboe… …and an Ellingboe can’t stand a Krum! That is why. Now, I just know you didn’t mean to disrespect all of that heritage, right? – Right. – And it won’t happen again, will it? Of course not. Now, tell me all about where this pretty thing came from. Ugh. Let me guess. Leaving it at the gate not an option? You really have a way with words, you know? Of course, you don’t… Of course, don’t even answer that… I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! You rotten vermin! – Me, me, me! – Pick me! – Out of the way! – Mine first! I want a bicycle! – Tell Mr. Klaus I want a bicycle! – Shut up! – Take my letter! Take my letter! – Mine! Me! Me first! Me first! A doll! -Me! Me! Me! – Okay! Okay! Single line! Chop-chop! Fall back! All right. Everyone, in line. – There you go. – Get out! Move. Letter? Good. Letter? Good. Got it. Get out of here. Great. Move along. – What’s wrong with her mouth? – She’s not from here. She’s Saami. Right, that’s nice. But I see no letter, so please come back when you have one. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. Okay, any other letters? – Here! Here! Here! – Me, me, me! Good. The rest, you know the deal. No letter, no toy. But we don’t know how to write. Tough luck, kid. Wait, you know what you could do? – What are you doing? – Aah! Telling children to go to school to learn to write? What is wrong with you? Yeah, yes. What I meant to do… Listen to me, Postman. Whatever you’re doing, leave me out of it. I have been rotting away here for five years, and I am so close to getting out. I am not about to let you mess it all up. You got it? These children wasting away without a proper education? I mean… Forgive me, I’m kind of a dreamer, but… isn’t that why we do it? Hmm? Hmm? Why you became a teacher? So you could make a difference? Ah. Young love. Takes me back, you know? The intense looks, the palpitation of the heart. The whimpering and the soiling of the pants, no. I can’t relate to so much. So you go to sleep, and when you wake up in the morning, the present is right there by the fireplace! Yeah, Mr. Klaus is amazing! – Yeah, he’s awesome. – Yeah! “Klaus”? “Awesome”? He’s huge, but he can squeeze down any chimney! – Really? How? – I don’t know. Magic, I guess. Ow! There. Ugh. If you leave your socks hanging on the mantle, Mr. Klaus will fill them with toys! He only comes when you’re sleeping. No one has ever seen him. It’s like he’s invisible or something. Aah! Oh, and he likes cookies. Don’t forget to leave out some cookies. Go home, you loser! Hmm. Who’s the loser now, you little brat? Mr. Klaus is the coolest. Hey, have you heard about Klaus? His name is Klaus, and he makes the best toys. – Klaus. – Klaus. – Klaus. – He’s awesome. His toys are the best. – What happened? – Not a word. You just sit there, be all magical and awesome. What? Are we going to learn something today? Look, if you have to be here, at least be quiet. Why don’t you go ahead and just, I don’t know, write vowels or something? We don’t have notebooks. Or pens. All right. Okay, let’s make a deal. if I teach you something, will you get out of here? Please? Mmm-hmm. There you go. Really? That’s my name? Yes. Yay, it’s your name. Wow. Can you teach me more? – Please? – Me next! – I want to write my name. – Me too. I want to write my name. – Pick me! – I want to write my name! – Me too! I want to write my name! – Teach me! – I want to write my name! – Me next! Too heavy. Okay, then. I can go by myself. You don’t have to… I mean, no offense, but someone could use a little diet cleanse. What are you doing? Less presents, less weight. Less presents? But less presents means less letters, and less letters means less… more children’s dreams being shattered. No. No, no, no, I won’t allow it. We have a sworn duty for the children. Aah! Gotcha! Aah! Hmm. Come here! Come on! Aah! Ow! Ow! Right. I wear them down, and you catch them. Good teamwork… Whoa! Whoa! – Waah! Whoo! – Whoa ho ho! – Whoo hoo hoo! – Whoa ho ho! – That’s right. – Good call, reindeer. This is good teamwork here. – We’re making good time. – Reliable, strong, cooperative.

Delivering these toys, seeing the joy they bring to children, I thought I’d never feel this again. And I have you to thank for it, my friend. So… thank you. Of course. – Hey, you know what? We’re doing it! – What? – Doing what? – The Christmas thing! We’re making all those toys! – That’s what she would’ve wanted. – Really? Yeah, really! And with a whole year of planning, – we can expand to more villages next year. – Next year? – And more the year after that! – But I won’t… I mean, who knows what’s gonna happen next year?

All right, that’s it for today. And, um… homework! Oh! Uh… I forgot about homework. You know what? No homework. Am I the best teacher ever or what? What… – happened here? – Oh. Yeah, I thought I would give the place an update. Everybody knows rotting fish is so over. How did you pay for this? Hmm? – Your savings? – Well, not all of it. Actually, yeah, all of it. But check it out. I think it looks pretty good. What about starting far, far away from here? Where’s that Alva? Someone would have to be pretty stupid to want to leave this place now. Don’t you think? I… guess. You guess? Oh, wow. You have no idea what you’ve done, do you? Ugh. Come on. I’ll show you. Now, would you take a look at that? ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ Merry Christmas, Miss. Alva! – Merry Christmas, Mr. Postman! – Merry Christmas. Good evening, Postman Johanssen. – Hello. – Miss. Alva. Not quite the same place, is it? Hey. What’re you doing here? A true act of goodwill, huh? Always sparks another. Never fails. Remember, put the letter in the envelope. – And pass it down the line. – Come on! It doesn’t have to rhyme. – That’s right, keep at it. – Keep it short and sweet! No extra points for good spelling. – Oh, you’re doing so great, pumpkin. – Let’s go! One letter! Come on, it doesn’t have to be Shakespeare, people. Whoa! Steady, ol’ girl! Easy does it. Oh, wow! Uh-huh. Smooth lines. Good. Nice work. Hello! Hi. What am I supposed to do, huh? Stay forever in this little town? Hanging out with an old woodsman? Surrounded by crazy people? Never wanting anything more? Okay, are you gonna do that part or… How about you finish these and… Whoa! They insisted, and I didn’t want to be rude. I don’t know… What do you… Pfft. It’s a lot of red. What do you… Is it too much? No. We’ll just blindfold the reindeer so they don’t get dizzy. – That’s all. I’m kidding. – Aw… I’m kidding. I’m kidding. It looks great. It looks good. It’s nice. It’s… Hello, Jesper. Dad? What? Sorry. Let’s, um… Let’s talk outside. It’s a little cramped in here. Dad, what’re you doing here? Time isn’t up yet. I’ve still got a few days until… Fourteen thousand letters out of Smeerensburg? Well, I had to come and see it for myself. Dad, you can’t just show up and… Wait, what? 14,000? – That’s not right. It… – Oh, but it is. Don’t be so modest. What’re they doing here? They were the ones who alerted me to what you’ve accomplished here. We couldn’t let such a feat go unrewarded. Listen, whatever they told you… Well, then, ready to go? Go? Where? Home, of course. A deal’s a deal. The ordeal is over. Home? With the personal butler and the breakfast in bed and… my silk sheets? No one deserves it more. Wouldn’',\n",
       "  't you agree, Mr. Klaus? Oh, he was unbelievable! Encouraging children to write letters and go to school! Convincing the locals to donate their labor to… such a worthy cause. Indeed. Well, shall we then? Perhaps a minute to say your goodbyes, of course. Please, I can explain. I was… Oh, it’s very clear. You just duped everyone so you could get back to your puffed-up life back in the big town. Something like that? No! No. Well, at first maybe, yes, but, Alva, please come… Alva, please come back. If I, I didn’t get the letters, I’d be cut off, but things changed! Jesper! Jesper! Márgu… Klaus, just listen. I… Everybody’s out to get something, right? I thought… well, a bit of hardship might help straighten you out, but even I must admit that… Well, let’s just say that there’s certainly a bright future for the man who brought postal service to Smeerensburg, that’s for sure. And speaking of the future, I look forward to discussing… One down, one to go. If you ask me “who” right now, I swear! Well, now, finally leaving, aren’t we? I… uh… Anchors away, Captain. – We’re sailing off at once. – Well, that’s a first. I beg your pardon? Never saw a postman looking more miserable leaving than on the day they came in. Oh, well. Best leave it alone, I say. I’m sure it’s nothing that could fester and eventually become a source of resentment and regret. Jesper! Jesper. Cheer up, little one. I think I may have missed my boat. Jesper! So I told him. I told him everything. And then he turned to me, and he said… …he’d never been more proud of me. And he hugged me. Can you believe that? I thought he’d be mad. Well, yeah, sure. I’ll miss it. The big house, the having my every whim tended to, the silk sheets. Oh, God, the silk sheets! Can we change the subject? Anyways, anybody can get off a boat. The real trick is gonna be convincing Klaus and Alva to give me an… What? What’s that? It’s the clans! Klaus! Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. A little bit… Well, well. Isn’t this convenient? What’re you doing here? Why, we were just thinking, “Don’t our children also deserve a present?” And lookie here! You’ve already got her favorite thing in the world. A nice, big piñata! Hey, you put… …one hand on those toys and I swear I… Stand back. All right. Do what you will with the toys. But no one gets hurt. Suits us just fine. How long until children go back to the old ways once there are no toys to bribe them with? How long until they turn against each other? And how long until the grown-ups follow? Jesper? The postman! Ha! Eat our snow, you… They’re not attached. Why aren’t they attached? I thought they were attached. I would never, in a million years, have done what I just did if I didn’t think these were attached. After them! Who leaves a sleigh unattached like… Aah! Destroy those toys! – Stop them at any cost! – Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine… Mine! I could really use a hand here. “Use.” Interesting choice of word. Really? You’re gonna go for the guilt trip now? Smash those toys to pieces! The toys! – We have to close that bag! – What do you care? – I thought you were leaving. – Great. Sure. I’ll tell you what. Let’s continue discussing what a horrible person I am while I most likely break my neck trying to save the children’s toys, – why don’t we? – Get down there! Stop those toys! Uh… Klaus? Hmm. Nice move! How’d you know I wouldn’t get knocked off too? Never mind. Don’t answer that. – Mine! – Whoa! Go! Go! We’re dead! We’re dead! We’re dead! Mine! Mine! Pumpkin! I’m still proud of you, you hear me? Mine? We’re losing toys! Oh, no! – Stop! Stop! – Oh, my goodness! Oh, no, no, no! No! Jesper! Let go! – It’s not worth it! – Are you crazy? No! See? Nothing to it. Just… I wouldn’t be so sure. Wait! No, no, no! No! No, no, no! No! This town was built on resentment and spite. And it’ll stay that way as long as a Krum… Or an Ellingboe! Ugh. …have something to say about it. Let’s go. We’re done here. Well said. Wait, does that mean the feud is back on? No more truce? First thing tomorrow. A true act of goodwill. What was that? A true act of goodwill… always sparks another. I think you hit your head pretty hard, dear. You should lie back down. You don’t believe me? Turn around. What? Turn around. Mine. – Pumpkin! – Honey! – Drop that immediately! – Mine! – Honey! Sweetie! – Let go and come back here right now. – Get down from there! – Mine! It’s Mama calling. – Put the boy down. – Remember Mama? You don’t k',\n",
       "  'now where he’s been. Klaus, I don’t know what to say. If I hadn’t… What’s this? The presents in the sleigh were all fake? Give me a little credit. I wasn’t going to let them have the toys. – But how did you know that… – Kids talk, you know? And if kids happen to be talking about their parents plotting to form an angry mob, then, you know, teachers listen. It was a simple plan. They would destroy the decoys and leave. But then you showed up and made it complicated. As usual. So, all this was for nothing? Oh, I wouldn’t say that. Shall we then? He came! He came! – Yeah! – Mine’s the big one! I told you! I told you he would come! Mom! Come here, quick! – Yes! – Yeah! – It’s just what I wanted! – He came! He came! He came! Dad! Mom! Wake up! You have to see this! Life went on. And Smeerensburg continued to change for the better. Poetic, don’t you think? As for Alva and I… well, what’d you expect? Of course she loved me. Every year, come the Christmas season, the letters started pouring in. More and more each time, and from farther away. We did have to expand the operation, just like we had planned. More children, more toys, more towns. It’s so bright you can even see at night. Oh, look over there! See the red and yellow along the rim? The years went by. Any chance for a hot cup of coffee for your neighborhood mailman? What is on your face? What? You don’t like it? I think it looks good on me, don’t you? Be honest. Alva hates it. Each better than the last. And then, on the 12th year… I’m coming, love. I looked for him everywhere. I asked everyone, but we just couldn’t find him. No goodbye. No explanation. Nothing. It was as if he had just… faded away. All right. I’ve got two urgent deliveries here, Postmaster, sir! The letters are getting in the envelope. Proceed to stamp the letter. Another stamp. Signed, sealed, to be delivered! – Nighty night, kids! – Go to sleep, now. Night, Mom! Night, Dad! Good night. Good night. What happened to him after that… how, why… I can’t even begin to comprehend. I stopped trying to make sense of it a long time ago.

But a new boss baby with a cutting-edge approach and a can-do attitude is about to bring them together again … and inspire a new family business. Tim and his super-mom wife Carol live in the suburbs with their super-smart 7-year-old daughter Tabitha, and super-cute new infant Tina. Tabitha, who’s at the top of her class at the prestigious Acorn Center for Advanced Childhood, idolizes her Uncle Ted and wants to become like him, but Tim worries that she’s working too hard and is missing out on a normal childhood. When baby Tina reveals that she’s—ta-da!—a top-secret agent for BabyCorp on a mission to uncover the dark secrets behind Tabitha’s school and its mysterious founder, Dr. Erwin Armstrong, it will reunite the Templeton brothers in unexpected ways, leading them to re-evaluate the meaning of family and discover what truly matters. * * * (grand orchestral fanfare playing) (gentle melody playing) ♪ ♪ TIM: Time is a funny thing.

Here at the center, we believe babies are the ultimate learning machines. Isn’t that right, little Nathan? Yeah! (chuckles): Okay. They should use their precious time to develop faster, push harder. Hmm. (Tim scoffs) Parents, they have the best intentions, of course, but they’re not experts. After all, the only thing holding your child back is… you. KIDS: You!

Now, in the past six months, these schools have been popping up all over the world. Uh, so what’s the problem? The school is the problem. Yeah. School is evil. No, Daddy, not all schools are evil. It’s just this one, okay? Okay. If Armstrong’s philosophy keeps spreading, it could be the end of childhood. No. Childhood was the worst three years of my life. That’s so sad. You probably just didn’t do it right. Huh? Aw. But luckily, you get a do-over. A second chance. BabyCorp has developed a new super-duper baby formula that can turn a grown-up back into a baby.

(groans) TED: Let him through. Okay, he’s cool. TIM: See? I’m cool. I’m cool. You failed me, Tim. I was desperate. I crawled. I did things with glue that I’m not proud of, but I made it. I made it all the way to Armstrong’s office, and then where’s Tim? I know. I… Where’s Tim? I tried to… Where’s Tim?! I was in the Box, okay? (babies gasping) TED: The Box? The Box? Glue. Yeah, that’s right. (whispers): The Box. Show a little respect. See, Tim, this is why I work alone. (sighs) I’ll succeed in the mission. You can take the pony home. The only thing you’re ever gonna succeed at is being alone. Fine. Fine! Fine! I like ponies. Aah! Thank you for sharing.

MEGHAN: One, two, three. NATHAN and MEGHAN: And one, two, three and one, two, three and one, two, three. And one, two… Oh, come on! Are you kidding me? I just can’t do it right now, okay? I can’t. I just can’t. I’ll do it tomorrow. MEGHAN: Seriously? (school bell rings) (kids cheering) NATHAN: All right, all right, all right. See you at the pageant tomorrow. Beat it!

What could be more important than my mission? Got to go. Lightspeed out. This is so great. (chuckles) Well, I hope you’re hungry. Been so long since I’ve used silverware.

You’re embarrassed of him? No. No, it’s not that. (Tim sighs heavily) It’s just, he’s really good at this kind of thing– being creative and using your imagination– but it’s hard for me. I just want him to be proud of me. You know? (coos) Really? Well, yeah. Um, who are these extra plates for? (doorbell rings) (whispers): Mom and Dad. Hey, hey! The key still works!

TED SR. and TABITHA: Selfie! How do you do it again? Bring out the baby. Hide! Where are you hiding that baby? No. Just be cool. Be cool. JANICE: There she is. TED SR.: Hello.

No more screen time. (clamoring stops) (whimpering) ARMSTRONG: Listen. Believe it or not, I used to be just like you. (cooing) Yes. I even had parents. Mine were child psychologists who made me part of an experiment. Really? They exposed me to 10,000 hours of Mozart, language lessons and public radio. Huh. Wow. I hate public radio. It was at that ',\n",
       "  'point I realized I was smarter than my parents. And with my first step, I ran away from home. (babies moan sadly) Why? They pushed me around. I got told what to do all the time. (crying) But a single word changed my life. “No.” Say it. ALL: No! Take a nap. Nyet! Put on your coat. Nein! Eat your vegetables. Nahii! Are you gonna let grown-ups push you around? No, no! No, no, no! No, no! No, no, no! Are you? Good God, no. That’s right. Why do parents get to be in charge, anyway? They had their chance, and what did we get? Pollution, politics, wars. BABIES: Ooh. Not “ooh.” “Boo.” ALL: Boo! The only thing holding us back is them, but not anymore. The moment that we’ve worked so hard for is almost here. B-Day. (babies cheering) B-Day? B-Day. I’m this many. I’m this many. No, no, it’s not… it’s not your birthday. It’s the beginning of the baby revolution. Yay, yay. (babies cheering) And there’ll be cake. Cake for everybody. BABIES (chanting): Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! No more rules. (chanting continues) Oh là là! No more parents. Uh-oh. Pew, pew, pew, pew! Sayonara, Mama and Papa! Oh, this is bad.

Show me how to download that. Everyone has it. So, Marcos… Lightspeed? Is that what you said? Mm-hmm. Sounds like a cartoon name. (laughing) It really does. (laughs awkwardly) Well, my parents, they’re a little wacky, so… (slurping) Huh. It’s like I know you from somewhere. I don’t think so. That is a keeper, too. Hey. Hey. Doesn’t he look familiar? I don’t think I do. Yeah, he looks just like Tim. Yeah. You look like Tim. (coughs) Hmm? Huh? Except Tim didn’t wear glasses. Oh, that’s right. (scoffs) Huh. Well, how about that. (Tina sighs) Hey, where is Tim, anyway? Tim and Ted are on a trip. TED SR. and JANICE: Together? They’re bonding. Well, that’s about time. Yeah. I just hope Tim’s back in time for the pageant.

Well, Marcos, Tim Time is like a black hole where things like reality and being on time get lost. (Tabitha laughs) Oh. Tabitha’s father has a very active imagination. Which is a good thing. Yeah, that’s a… I’d say that’s a good thing. Oh, remember when he said our boss was trying to kidnap us? He did? (laughter) TED SR.: Or that his baby brother could walk and talk but only when we weren’t looking. (laughter) (“William TellOverture” playing) (chuckling): Wow. Turn around. TABITHA: That’s so Dad. You know, Ted was quite a handful himself. Oh, he could be very… TED SR.: Uptight. JANICE: Mm. Yes. High-strung. Oh. Remember the time he sued us? (laughter) JANICE: Teenagers. Ugh. He really looked up to his big brother, though. BOTH: He did? JANICE: Oh, yeah. He wouldn’t leave him alone. Everything Tim did, Teddy wanted to do. TABITHA: Really? Yeah. Tagalong Teddy, we called him. (Tabitha chuckles) JANICE: Well, not to his face. TED SR.: No, no. Not to his face. He was very litigious. But you know what? Your dad didn’t mind. He was so proud of his little brother. Oh, yeah. He loved showing him off. TED SR.: Those guys did everything together. JANICE: They were best friends. Just like you and me. (Tina giggling) Right, Tina? Best friends forever. Tickle monster! (Carol chuckles) CAROL: That’s so sweet. TABITHA: And this is my closet. TIM: Oh, cool closet. And this is my bed.

We didn’t know anything about the real world. And eventually, you have to grow up. Just because you grow up, it doesn’t mean you have to grow apart. I don’t know. Maybe it’s already too late. TIM (grunting): Hey. Sorry I’m late. TINA: Daddy! Daddy, Daddy. What’s going on? Uncle Ted really misses you. Isn’t that nice? (toy train whistle blows) So, hey, uh, what you doing? Oh, I was, uh… I don’t know, I was just working on this. (gasps) Look, I’m sorry about what I said at recess. What happens on the playground stays on the playground. I was just worried about Tabitha, you know? She’s your daughter. I get it. This whole time, I was thinking about what I wanted and not what she needed. I think I finally got this parenting thing figured out. Gold star for you, Daddy. Keep it up, Pops. Yeah, well, about that. Armstrong wants to get rid of parents somehow. Sorry, what? He’s planning a baby revolution. Ugh, come on. Just when I got good at this whole parenting thing. We got to stop him. Not we. You? Neither one of us. BabyCorp is taking it from here. Ah. So, what, they’re gonna send in the Baby SEALS or something? Looks like it. So you’ll, um… you’ll be headed back to your office. TED: Uh, yeah. Well, keep in touch, Tim. Hello? BabyCorp? Thank goodness, BabyCorp. Well, BabyCo… (stammering): Wha-What? What are you saying, there’s not enough evidence, BabyCorp? I… Uh-oh. So you’re not gonna do anything? But, BabyCorp, I… Ugh. Well, then we’ll take care of it. You know what, BabyCorp? I quit! What a bunch of diaper sniffers. (grunts) (whistle blows, train powers down) Looks like we have to stop Armstrong ourselves. We’re going rogue. I like it. So the mission’s back on? Yeah. If you two can put up with each other a little longer. I suppose I can live with that. Tim? I think that’s doable. Yay! Forced together again. WIZZIE: It’s 8:45 p.m. TED: Okay. Our clock is ticking. We have to stop Armstrong before the formula wears off. Working as a team, we will strike at the pageant. Go, Tina. Now, this top secret document… Sweetie, it’s the program. This top secret program reveals that Armstrong is scheduled to address the audience, which he will do right here at the very end. We need someone backstage. Tim, that’s you. How am I gonna get backstage if I’m not in the pageant? TED: My people will take care of that. (toy squeaks) Ah! Thank you. (chuckles) Thank you. No! Great. And… go. (laughing) Glue. (screams) ROBOT VOICE: There, there. All better. Awesome. Now, I’ll be your eyes and your ears in the audience. I can’t let Mommy see me talk, or she’s gonna start squealing and hugging me, but these little doodads will let you understand my baby talk. It’s called a GAGA device. Aw, that’s cute. Check it out. (speaks gibberish) (over GAGA): Can you hear me, Daddy? Also cute. Meanwhile, with my new purple status, I can stay close to Armstrong. Um, that’s-that’s an eyebrow. Oh. Sorry. Uh, no, that’s, uh… TED: When the moment is right, I’ll implant a device. Got it. Got what? I mean, you’ve got this. Go get ’em, tiger. (chuckles) Oh, thank you, parents. (applause) Thank you. There’s the… There’s the old enthusiasm I like to see. TINA: This will allow me to control his suit. I can make Muttonchops do whatever I want. (babbling) TINA: I can make him dance. I can make him prance. Hey, no, no, no, no. Including exposing himself to the audience. (audience gasps) (screams) Every parent will pull out their phone. Don’t look at me. Don’t look at me! The photos will spread like a diaper rash. Cut to our pizza party. Boom! Bam! Poo! Poof! Questions? After Tabitha sings her solo, right? After Tabitha sings. Now we just sit back, relax and enjoy the show. (fanfare playing) ARMSTRONG: Welcome, parents, to our holiday pageant. Remember, flash photography in the auditorium is absolutely okay. Take a picture. Show your kids that you love ’em. Yippee! Come on, Tim. You promised you’d be here. (man groans) Oh, sorry. This seat is taken. Yep. Sorry. Oh, no. (mutters) So sorry. I… Sorry.

       " ['Inspired by an epic Chinese tale, THE MONKEY KING is an action-packed family comedy that follows a charismatic Monkey (Jimmy O. Yang) and his magical fighting Stick on an epic quest for victory over 100 demons, an eccentric Dragon King (Bowen Yang), and Monkey’s greatest foe of all —his own ego! * * * [mysterious music plays] [narrator] For thousands of years, Buddha oversaw the universe. And the Immortal Ones in heaven and kings in hell watched over earthly affairs. Demons walked among us, and dragons ruled the sea. Everything was in balance. We respected the gods, and we followed the rules until the night a magical rock gave birth to a powerful being. [dramatic music crescendos] [narrator] Meet trouble. [squeaks] Oh. Ooh. [squeaks] [jaunty music plays] [giggles] Okay, okay. Attention, everyone. We have important business to discuss. I, your Jade Emperor, Architect of the Universe and Lord of the Immortals, shall throw the greatest, most fantastic banquet since the one we did last Tuesday. Doesn’t that sound fun, hmm? Understood, Your Majesty. Now, seating arrangements. Place the Immortal Ones at my head table. Minor gods by the kitchen in the back… [Jade Emperor yells] [cat meows] [cat meows] [monkey screeches] What on Earth? [laughs] [squeals] [monkey grunts] [squeals] Hm, an uncontrollable monkey shooting light beams from his eyes? He’s probably just excited, Your Majesty. We can’t have that. Get rid of him. [deep voice] Patience. [Jade Emperor shrieks] Buddha! I didn’t see you there. [Buddha] This monkey is a powerful being. He has an important destiny. Let him find his way. Very well. I mean, what’s the worst it can do, right? Where were we? Ah, dessert! I’m thinking a ten-foot egg tart sculpture of me. [suspenseful music plays] [monkey cackles] [baby monkey giggles] [monkey mother coos] [tranquil music plays] Ah! Oh. [baby monkey squeals] Oh! [monkey sighs] [monkey mother screeches] A wise monkey never stretches beyond his grasp. [grunts] [sighs] [elder monkey grunts] Will you let go? [monkey laughs] Ow! Ah. Huh? As I was saying, if the coconut is meant for us, it will be within reach. Mm. Not today. Oh! [monkeys gasp] Out of the light! [monkey grunts] [elder monkey groans] [monkeys laugh] [elder monkey growls] No, no, no, no! We live in a world of rules and order. Oh? Observe. Think of my palm as our universe. Compared with this greatness, one little monkey is an insignificant pebble. Only the Immortal Ones in heaven are free to live without rules. Know your place, young one. Oh! [young monkeys screech] [monkey laughs] [screeching] [elder monkey] Come back here right this minute! Out of the light! [suspenseful music crescendos] [jaunty music plays] [monkeys giggle] Come back!

Pew! [grunts] [rock music continues] Ha ha! Okay, imaginary family, give me some love. Oh, too slow. Mwah! [gasps] [elder monkey] Come. Gather ’round, young ones. Aw. Feel the safety. [demon growls] Huh? [tense music plays] [monkey gasps] Feel your insignificance. Breathe… Nap time’s over! You again? You’re in danger! Follow me and… [gasps] [demon growls] [baby monkey whimpers] [demon growls] Ha ha! Huh? [monkey grunts] [demon growls] I, uh, thought that would play out differently. [monkey yells] [dramatic music plays] [baby monkey shrieks] Come on! It’s getting away! You fool! You think you’re some kind of hero? But I can beat that thing. And save the baby? Sure. If there’s time. With what? Coconuts? Coconuts are no threat to the Demon of Havoc. He could get a weapon. Ha. From where? Oh, oh, I know! From the Dragon King. Yeah, the Dragon King. [scoffs] At the bottom of the sea? If you go out there, you will die. [scoffs] Says you. Crazy fool! One weapon coming right up. [mysterious music plays] [henchman 1] Coming to the stage, let’s give it up for… [henchman 2] The reptile of style. The overboard overlord. With the sweetest vocal cords. [both] The Dragon King! My loyal subjects… this grand column has stood here since the dawn of time. It has waited patiently for the mightiest, fiercest rebel with the best style, of course, to free its monumental potential. That rebel is me! My gorgeous machine will unleash the column’s power to create the greatest storm the world has ever seen. [tranquil music plays] Wow! [column hums] You talk? [humming continues] You’ve been waiting for me? How long? [column hums] Well, five minutes isn’t… Five thousand years? The days when sea creatures are looked down upon by those air-breathing dry-landers are over! [creatures chatter] [tranquil music continues] [column hums] You’re looking for the most powerful being? No way! I’m actually on a quest for the ultimate weapon! What are the odds, man? [column hums] There’s gotta be some way we can help each other. If you were just a little smaller, maybe I could… Oh, whoa! Let our conquest begin! But first, a song. And five, six, seven, eight! Huh? Whoa! Is this part of the show? What is happening? [henchman 2] Look out! [Dragon King] Someone’s stealing the grand column! Is that a monkey? [tense music plays] [monkey laughs] Whoa! You are incredible! [dramatic music crescendos] [cuttlefish] Excuse me, sire, but… Zip it. I have a call to make. [jaunty music chimes] [serene music plays] I demand satisfaction. Oh, it’s you. What is it? I’m busy. A monkey stole my grand column. So? So? Someone could do a lot of damage with that th',\n",

I shall take things into my own claws, and woe to those that… Oh! Ugh! So it’s the monkey who’s the mightiest, fiercest rebel. With the best style. Yeah. And he swiped the one thing you need to take over the world. What a guy! [growls] [cuttlefish] Oh no! Any other comments? Input? Friendly feedback? Not me. Mm-mm. Nope. No? Then draw me a bath! [monkey 1 gasps] The outsider’s back. [monkey 2] He didn’t die. [monkey 3] He got a weapon. [scoffs] He got a stick. [gulps] We can do this, right?

The ultimate weapon for the ultimate hero! [elder monkey] Absurd! You’re a tiny pebble, remember? He doesn’t love you. He just wants you to love him! You’ll never be one of us. You’re a selfish, rebellious fool, who will end up all alone. Hmm. [Stick murmurs] [scoffs] I’m not alone. I have my Stick. That weapon should be wielded by one of the Immortal Ones. So wait. You’re saying I should be an Immortal One? What? No! Ah, that’s interesting. They do whatever they want up there, right? That’s me. No rules. Me again. [monkeys murmur] Best weapons? Uh-huh. Very much us. [Stick murmurs] You’re right. I don’t belong here. I belong with them! [monkeys cheer] [monkeys] Monkey King! They’d never accept the likes of you. I conquered a demon. You’d have to defeat a hundred demons to even get their attention. Oh yeah. [elder monkey scoffs] I suppose you’re right. [scoffs] Of course I’m right. One hundred demons coming up!

You’re the worst daddy ever. [Mayor] Now, son, don’t hit Daddy. Where’s my snack? Hey! Ow! Oh dear. What? [Monkey King] That was for free. How dare you challenge Red Girl, Monkey King? What’s a Red Girl? I am Red Girl! [distorted] Quake in my presence and bow to my awesome power! Hey, Red Girl, leave these poor, unattractive people alone. But the kids are ripest this time of year. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. [shrieks] Daddy! So yummy! [dramatic music plays] Okay, Monkey King, what’s the play? Are you gonna… Okay, little girl. I can take it from here. Ha! [yells] Get her, Monkey King! [exciting music plays] [Monkey King grunts] [Red Girl] Hey, cut that out! Behave! Hey, you’re a little scrawny for number 100, but we’ll make it work. Hai-yah! [Monkey King laughs] [exciting music continues] Bad monkey! [Monkey King] Like I care! [Red Girl snarls] Don’t give up now. Ha! You’re doing great. [Red Girl gasps] [Monkey King laughs] Hey, stop that! Ugh! Congratulations! The Monkey King’s last victim. You’re gonna be famous. Ow! [Red Girl yelps] Uh-oh. Stick! [Stick murmurs] Goodbye, Monkey! [laughs] [Monkey King yells] [Monkey King] Yes! [yells] Frustrated! Bam! [Red Girl yells] Whoa! That Monkey’s gonna burn down the whole village. Come on, everyone. [grunts] [man] Come on! Hai-yah! Agh! My fireworks shop! [grunting] [screaming] Over here. Water coming up. Toss it, kid. [grunts] [Mayor’s wife grunts] [tense music plays] Ooh, ooh. Eat fire, loser! Back at ya. Whoa! [shrieks] Do you really think you can defeat me? No. I know it. [yells] And for the beef dish, sire, lettuce-wrapped or skewers? [yelps] Skewers it is. [Monkey King] Incoming! [laughs] [Red Girl screams] Daddy, I’m hungry! Now, son… [screams] It’s the monkey! Not my house! [Monkey King laughs] [Mayor sobs] [Monkey King laughs] [Red Girl laughs] Creepy. Oh! Stick! Burn, Monkey, burn! [Red Girl laughs] Boom! What a team! Where did you get that stick? It’s fantastic! [Stick murmurs] Good idea, Stick. Hey, you want it? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Gimme, gimme, gimme! If you can hold it for ten seconds, it’s yours. [Red Girl] One, two… Four… Seven… [Red Girl] Four… Seven… Five. [Red Girl] Stop! [Monkey King] Four… Eight… [Red Girl] One… Two… Three… [yells] You let go! [Stick murmurs] Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Mwah! One-hundredth demon vanquished! Monkey King reigns supreme! [Stick protests] And Stick. Incredible. You got her to fall right into your trap. I will learn so much from you. [groans] You’re still here? Please. My name is Lin. I am but a lowly peasant girl from a tiny village who hopes to make a difference someday. I offer my skills as your humble assistant and weapon-bearer. Wow. My own assistant? Hard pass. This monkey heroes alone. Oh. So, you got my big victory speech ready, right? Um, well, I… Well, then, grab yourself a scroll and take notes because it’s, ha, party time! [Mayor’s wife] Crazy monkey! [villagers scream] Kaboom! Yeah! “How fortunate we poor ignorant villagers…” Hm? Mm-hm. “…are tonight to witness the mighty Monkey King’s heavenly ascension to join the Immortal Ones.” “He saved our town.” Sort of. [Stick murmurs] “He is the bravest, most spectac… spectac…” Are you sure? It’s a word. “…spectacul-errific-amazing-derful hero the world has ever known.” “Wait for applause.” [light applause] Whoo! Monkey King! “And now a song.” “Music and lyrics by a handsome artist who, um, wishes to remain anonymous.” [Monkey King laughs] Hm. ♪ Who’s the handsome hero We all love and adore? ♪ ♪ Monkey King! ♪ ♪ Who has demons screaming When he knocks on their door? ♪ ♪ Monkey King! ♪ ♪ Who’s the simian you’ll find shimmying Up to the top ♪ ♪ And you know he won’t stop Till he’s won? ♪ ♪ That’s right, it’s the Monkey King! ♪ Eh, you were a little flat. Ya! [Lin] Yeah! Monkey King! [Dragon King] Hm. It appears the ape didn’t succumb to our fiery little minx as I’d hoped. Time to move. Are you sufficiently moisturized, Your Grace? You know what happens in the dry night air. [Dragon King] Hm. Good point. [Dragon King sighs contentedly] Onward! [henchmen panting] Here’s your medal. Yes. So, where are the Immortal Ones? Yeah, we were promised gods! They’re coming. Move. [Mayor yelps] Ouch! [clears throat] One hundred demons defeated. Wow. What an accomplishment. The Immortal Ones can welcome me with open arms now. I said now! Now? Hello? This thing on? [thunder crashes] They’re here! See, peasants! Behold as I ascend! [Dragon King] You! Ho ho! Huh? You are no hero! You’re a thief! Aw, you’re not the Immortal Ones. Uh-oh. That is mine! What’s wrong, Stick? You know this chump? [Stick groans] Stick? You never talked to me. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Who are you anyway? I am the undersea ruler of the… What? Oh, look at his face. [Dragon King coughs] Low humidity. Arid climate. [villagers] Ew! Don’t look at me! No, no, no. Be right back. [Dragon King sigh',\n",
       "  's] [Dragon King] So invigorating. …undersea ruler of the dragon kingdom. What? Come on. And you, sir, stole my stick. No, I didn’t. I found it at the bottom of the ocean. Right in the middle of some tacky palace. Tacky? Once I reclaim my stick, you and all these air-breathers will suffer my… my… Again? Arid climate. No. Look away! [water splashes] [Dragon King sighs] …suffer my wrath! [dramatic music crescendos] There’s supposed to be a lightning crash. And there it is. [laughs] Hey, Babbo, how will we know when we’re under the stick? Easy. The stick will be right above us. How will we know we took the right stick? [scoffs] There’s only one choice. But what if we choose wrong, Babbo? Look at that armor. Who even wears brass with gold? Look, buddy, I hear ya. You love my stick. Everyone loves the stick. But no one appreciates the stick like I do. [Stick murmurs urgently] Quiet! The grown-ups are talking. And now you’re ruining my exclusive ceremony. Point is, Stick is not going anywhere. Ain’t that right, Stick? Buddy? [henchman 2] Ow! Uh-oh. Hey, are they with… [dramatic music plays] Stick, stay strong! I’m coming! Oh no! [henchmen laugh] [henchmen yell] [henchmen groan] [Monkey King] Hang on, Stick! Woo-hoo! [exciting music plays] [henchmen groan] What? [groans] [henchmen groan] [henchmen yell] Babbo, I’m gonna get sick! Stick, left! [henchmen groan] And to the right! [grunts] Ha ha! You missed! [henchmen yell] [exciting music continues] Stick, darling, it’s Dragon. He’s mine! Jump in the tub! He only listens to me, flaky. I don’t see a ring on it, honey! [grunts] Itching! Flaking! [exciting music continues] [grunts] [laughs] Huh. [dramatic music plays] Of course! An avalanche. Hit the brake! [Monkey King] Fun ride, huh? [henchmen groan] [Monkey King] See ya! [henchman 2] Babbo! [Babbo] Curse you, gravity! Ha ha! Monkey King reigns supreme! Huh? [Dragon King] Stick! Catch me! My palace is not tacky! [Stick hums] [Lin panting] Gotcha! [grunts] Dragon King? [Lin] Agh! Fear not, little girl. The villain is gone. Maybe you’re not as useless as I thought. So, do I have the job? Um… Nope. [Lin] Oh, come on. Twenty minutes, and still no invite from the Jade Emperor. What am I missing? [murmurs] Immortality! Of course. It’s right in the name. To become an Immortal One, I need immortality! [Lin] Maybe I can help. [Monkey King groans] Okay, look, kid. You see this? Your palm? No! I mean, yes. But no. This here is me. Okay? And this tiny thing is you. Get it now? Huh? [Monkey King] I’m the universe hand, and you’re an insignificant, useless pebble. Even a tiny pebble can make a big ripple, you know. [scoffs] That’s just what a tiny pebble would say. So, Stick, immortality, where do we go? [Stick hums] Really? Huh. But how do we get there? [Stick hums] A graveyard? Spooky. Huh… Grave… Gra… Graveyard. You can’t read. Of course I can. That’s grass. That’s the sky. That’s a rock. See? Reading. Graveyard’s that way. Obviously. [Stick hums] No, no, no, no, no. We don’t need her. He wants me to come. Doesn’t he? Just go home, kid. I can’t go home. There’s trouble back there, and it made me do some things. Things I probably shouldn’t have done. Ooh! You killed someone? No! Oh. I just wanna do big things someday. Like you. Ow! [Stick murmurs] I know. No. I… [Stick murmurs] Yes, but… [Stick murmurs] How much reading could we possibly need? [Stick murmurs] Fine. I said fine! [sighs] So, assistant girl, you coming or what? [Lin] So, where to next? [Monkey King] Oh, you’ll see. [laughs] [Monkey King] Ooh. In there? Us? How? This. It’s like an all-access VIP pass. Any realm, any dimension. Even the Land of the Dead. But you’re not dead. And if all goes well, never will be. Okay. If we’re gonna fit in, we gotta dress the part. [coughs] What the heck? [Monkey King] Not heck. Hell. [Lin screams] [suspenseful music crescendos] [Lin screams and groans] Try to keep up. [grunts] Are we even supposed to be here? Absolutely not. Isn’t it great? See, the day you’re supposed to die is recorded in the Scroll of Life and Death. But if my name should somehow get crossed out, then no death registered, and guess who’s immortal? Me! [laughs] [shudders] One more thing. Die in hell, stay in hell. So don’t die. This is a bad idea. [demon] Next. [ghosts whisper] Act like a ghost. Whoo! Eee! Oh yeah. Great. You’re giving me chills. King here! Coming through! Make way. Next! Release form. [groans] You brought a live chicken to the underworld? No living things allowed! We really should go now. [scoffs] Watch and learn, Pebble. [chicken squawks] Oh no. That’s better. Pit of Infinite Agony. Fourth floor on your right. Next! Yes, good morning. I’d like a quick glance at the Life and Death Scrolls. Release form first. It’s in my other armor? Rejected! [growls] Release form. Back to the world of the living. Not so fast. As my assistant, your first duty… [Lin groans] …is to be the sacrificial lamb. What are you doing? She’s alive? Here in hell? What? You’re alive! How scandalous! And you cut in front of all these people? What? No living things allowed! Oh, Monkey! [Monkey cackles] Uh, uh, I… I’m not… I couldn’t be more dead. Fresh corpse here. How did you die? Old age. No, I mean scurvy. Earthquake? A duel. Two duels. Here’s the story. I fell… off a cliff into a hole filled with sharks. Rabid sharks. And then a house fell on me, and I drowned. Yeah. Okay, you’re in. Chamber of Ridiculous Deaths. Fifth floor down the hall. [gasps] Hm. Next! [Lin panting] [ominous music plays] [Lin grunts] [grunts] [screams] [ghost] What a guy. Hey! [screams] Monkey! You abandoned me in the middle of hell. You don’t leave a teammate behind. What teammate? You’re an assistant. An insignificant pebble. Stop calling me that. Absolutely. As soon as you find my scroll so I can cross my name off. Come on. [Lin groans] [metal clangs] [grunts] This shouldn’t take long. [Lin gasps] [Lin] What? Get reading. [whistles] What’s your family name? Don’t have one. I was b',\n",
       "  'orn from a rock. A rock? More of a rock egg. The scrolls list your family history. I must have parents, right? Well, I guess. Everyone does. Ha! Looking for your scrolls? [laughs] My scroll? Why does he have my scroll? You don’t belong here, outsiders. Oh ho! Time to defeat demon 101. [demon] Mighty brush! Stamp of doom! Open! Hyah! [clone 1] Don’t let them get away! [clone 2] Capture them! [clone 3] Stop the monkey! Through 115. [clones grunt] Clones, eh? [Stick murmurs] I can? Really? Cool! [exciting music plays] [Monkey King grunts] Monkey King reigns supreme! [demon clones grunt] [Lin yelps] [Monkey King grunts] [clones grunt] Bring it! [grunts] [Monkey King] Woo-hoo! [grunting] Not the beard! Woo-hoo! Next! [Monkey King grunts] [Monkey King laughs] [Monkey King] Shaolin soccer! [yells] [Lin yelps] [demon grunts] Wait! Time-out. I’m not a part of this. Nobody’s on the bench! [Monkey King] Woo-hoo! [Stick murmurs] [demon] Get her! [Monkey King] Duck! Got ’em. [Lin yells] Monkey, I got ’em. This one’s mine. Huh? Hey! Not yours! What’s it say about my family? [yells] It says you don’t have one. Oh. I’m all alone? I’m sorry, Monkey. Which means… [demon grunts] Oof! I’m an original! One of a kind! Give me that scroll. Third line from the bottom. Step away from the scroll, you flea-bitten, mortal lowlife! Close! Come on! [Lin whimpers] [Monkey King] Uh-oh. [Lin screams] Got it. [grunts] Yeah, baby! Monkey King! Oh, her. [demon laughs] Ow! That hurt. [Monkey King] Hee-yah! [demon groans] [Monkey King laughs] And now I’m immortal! [Lin screams] [dramatic music plays] Even for hell, this is bad. [serene music plays] What’s up, Yama? Or should I say, what’s down? [laughs] I beseech you. A rogue primate has invaded hell and… Ow! Hey, uh, Jade Emperor, right? Listen, great news. Get the Immortal Ones together. I’m on my way. We’re gonna be neighbors. So you’re the Monkey King. Gonna party at your banquets. Get hammered. Release form! We’re gonna share battle stories. Please. You’re not one of us. Actually, I am. Crossed my name out and everything. That only makes you half-immortal. Half? You can’t die of old age. Oh, that’s great! But you can still die in battle. Huh? [Stick murmurs] Don’t look at me. This was your plan. Well, this is new information. So, how exactly does one get full immortality? You don’t. Not possible. Well, there is The Book of Everlasting Life, my lord. You shut your beard hole right now! My bad. Stick, door! [Stick murmurs] Assistant, book! Monkey, stay handsome. [Stick murmurs] [Lin grunts] [Monkey King laughs] [Yama groans] Whatever you do, don’t let him leave with that book! Let’s go. Oh! Don’t! [Lin groans] Uh-oh. [grunts] [Monkey King yelps] [dramatic music plays] [Monkey King yells] [Yama grunts] [Monkey King] Make way! [Lin yelps] Catch him! Catch him! [Monkey King laughs] [Lin] Agh! [dramatic music continues] [grunting] [Lin screams] [Monkey King] Hee-yah! [Lin screams] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Monkey! [dramatic music fades] Ha! Well, that was fun. You got the book? Uh, um, uh… You didn’t lose it, did you? Uh, uh… You had one job! One job and you blew it! Uh… Aha! Just messing with you! Do you treat all your friends like this? Friends? Whoa, okay. You’re more like a teammate on my very critical mission. Well, that’s better than a pebble. All right. Moving on. See this? This book can tell us how I can get my full immortality. Uh… What’s it say? Okay. Uh, it says… Oh. “Full immortality can be attained by eating a magical peach from the Enchanted Orchard of Everlasting Life.” Ooh! Where’s that? This could take a while. And I will give you five minutes. [Lin groans] [suspenseful music plays] This monkey’s insane. Oh really? He gets in fights, insults the gods. He just stole a book from hell! Oh yeah, did I mention? We went to hell! Okay, let’s bring the sass down to, like, a four, okay, sweetheart? I can’t keep this up. I can’t do this. Listen, honey, we made a deal. There’s no backing out now. Or did you forget? [sighs] I remember. [Lin] I beseech you, divine dragon. End our suffering. Our crops are dying. Could you please grace us with a rainstorm? [groans] We’ve been searching forever! What? Why aren’t the “wanted” posters working? But we put them up everywhere, Your Grace. There’s one. [Dragon King] Huh? What is this? I told you to draw the monkey, you dimwit! But, sire, monkeys are so much harder to draw than sticks. No, wait, wait! [yells] What the… [gasps] Divine Master of Weather. Thank you for answering my call. How dare you, a mere mortal, speak to his lordship. Avert your eyes. [Lin] My apologies. We have no food here. No water. Could you please, please send us rain? Well, aren’t you a presumptuous little snack. Wait, please! I’ll do anything. You must need something. An assistant. A servant. A human servant? Ha! He already has two perfectly good and trusted advisors. We carry his tub. [laughs] No! No. But perhaps our monkey would. Monkey? Would you lie for me? Get your paws dirty? You’ll have to be manipulative, vicious, and cunning. Do you have that in you, you scrumptious, sweet little thing? [Lin whimpers] Because when you make a deal with me, you follow through or… [licks lips] It’s chapped lips for you! [laughs] Benbo, he eats her. Oh! Yeah, that too. [laughs] Okay. I accept. Befriend a certain monkey, earn his trust, and take his stick. When it’s in my possession, you’ll get your rain. He never lets the stick out of his sight. The sooner it’s in my grip, the faster you’ll get your drip, drip, drip. Well, now he’s got me searching this stolen book for some Orchard of Everlasting Life. He’s still trying to join the Immortal Ones? [laughs] What a fool. What should I do? Hm. He wants an enchanted peach now, does he? Oh, well, I’ll just have to put on a little show and give him one. [laughs] All you need to worry about is getting him there. [Lin yelps] [Monkey King grunts] [Lin screams] You sure this is the right way to get to that fancy peach orchar',\n",
       "  'd? Yeah, definitely. [Monkey King grunts] Woo-hoo! [Lin] Do you have to go top speed? This? Ha! Please. I’ll show you top speed. No, no, no. I… Hey! Now, any personal assistant of mine really needs to be in the moment. Yeah, yeah. You need to be more focused and pay better attention. [Lin screams] [Lin grunts] [Lin grunts] [Lin panting] I need to know you’ll always have my back. Monkey! [groans] He’s coming back. He’s coming back. [Monkey King] And my shoes perfectly shined. He’s not coming back! It’s the attention to detail that I value most. Hee-yah! [Stick murmurs] Where to next? The hills? The desert? [unsettling music plays] Aw, man! [sighs] Trees. So many trees. I could’ve died peacefully in my village, but, no!

Remember, the tree in the light has the peach he should bite. If it’s hidden by night, then the fruit isn’t right. Got it? Okay. If the tree is in light, then, um, uh… It’s the peach he should bite. Oh yeah. So definitely not that tree. Yes, exactly that tree. But that tree’s not white. It’s more of a brown. No, not the color! I lit it up for you. See? Still nothing? So, it’s a glowing tree? Exactly. Wow. And once the monkey passes out, I’ll grab the stick and… Oh, here they come. Everybody back to one. Hit your marks. And let’s have some fun out there. Whoopsie-daisy! This one?

Those peaches were defective. Maybe they’re out of season. What? Our quest has failed, Stick. [Stick groans] [groans] You’re still half-immortal. I don’t do half-things. Yeah, I noticed. [sighs] This old geezer once told me all the things I couldn’t do. That I’d wind up alone. Yeah. “You’ll never amount to anything.” I heard that all the time back home. [sighs] Wow.

You only care about yourself. Well, no one else will. Ugh! ‘Cause you won’t let them. Someday, you really will end up all alone. [gentle music plays] Hm. Hm. [Stick murmurs] What are you yapping on about? [Stick murmurs] Who’s that? Assistant, what does it say? “An authority on everlasting life, the royal sorceress, Wangmu, can often be found in her laboratory brewing her famous Elixir of Immortality.” We’re back in the game! One sip and they’ll have to accept me. Way to go, Stick! Mwah! You too, Pebble. What are we waiting for? But that’s in heaven. Monkey King reigns supreme! [Lin yells] Is that the Jade Palace? Absolutely. [Monkey King grunts] [Lin screams] [exciting music plays] [Monkey King] Woo-hoo! What the… [Lin screams] [exciting music fades] [Lin] There she is. Wangmu.

I can’t fool around anymore. My people are counting on me. [Monkey King whimpers] Oh! Oh! Agh! Gee, why’d you trash this place? We’re guests here. [Lin groans] Show a little respect. Immortality Elixir? Hello? Come on. I’m not paying you to goof around. Yeah. Uh-huh. We’re not actually paying her, are we? [Stick hums] Right. The first ingredient is… There. A pinch of instant karma. Get mixing. [woman] Stealing from an old lady? You have no honor. Uh-oh. [laughs] First, I punish you. Then I shame you. You can’t shame me. I have no shame.

Your friend’s not here to protect you now. [laughs] Uh, we’re not friends. I’m his assistant. His what? [screams] I’m just a pebble. [Lin screams] I’m only after his stick. I need it to save my village from a drought. So, the thief’s assistant is also a thief. [laughs] [Monkey King] Woo-hoo! Take his stick and go! The Jade Emperor will see you home. [Lin grunts] What are you going to do to him? That selfish creature doesn’t care about you. Run! [sighs] [Wangmu] Ya! [Monkey King yells] Ha ha! Stick, where are you? Whoa! Back for more, Monkey? Uh-oh. [panting] Don’t look back! Don’t look back! Don’t look back. [Monkey King screams in pain] [Wangmu laughs] No, not this time. [Wangmu laughs] Goodbye, mortal. Half-mortal. [Monkey King groans] You couldn’t possibly think you were worthy to take your place here amongst us Immortal Ones. [Wangmu laughs] That was fun. [door opens] Huh? Monkey! Agh! Agh! [dramatic music plays] What? Oh ho ho! I love it when people tell me what I can’t do. [Wangmu grunts] [Monkey King yells] [laughs] Whoa! [laughs] [gasps] My lightning makes you stronger? I’m immortal! [Stick squeals excitedly] And huge! I’m one of you now. You will never be one of us! Monkey! Who’s gonna stop me? I summon the Immortal Ones! I’m already here! [Lin] They’re coming! We gotta get out of here! What are they gonna do? I can’t die. There are fates far worse than death. We really should go now. Bring ’em on! I am a god. Monkey! What? I’m busy! Bet you can’t catch me. Monkey King! [gasps] [Lin yells] He’s coming. He’s coming. He’s coming. He’s not coming! [Lin yells] [triumphant music plays] [panting] You came back for me. What’s your deal? You came back for me! I so could’ve beaten that old lady. But you didn’t because you care. No. Admit it. You care. Say it. No! Say, “I care.” Never. Come on, admit it! I admit nothing! He so cares about me. [Stick murmurs] I know! He was all like, “We’re not family. You’re a tiny pebble.” And then he saves me! [laughs] [Stick laughs] Are you two done? ‘Cause I got to get to the Jade Palace. To do what? Defeat all the Immortal Ones. Then I’ll become their ruler, the new king of heaven. Wait. Are you sure? Sounds kinda crazy. Yep! Whatever the Monkey King does, he does big! And you won’t ever stop? Not until the day I die. Which is? Never! I’m immortal! My thirst for new challenges will never end. I’ll never be satisfied. I’ll never be fulfilled. Which, when I say it out loud, sounds incredibly depressing. Wow! Did I just curse myself? [Stick g',\n",
       "  'roans] Maybe defeating everyone isn’t always the answer. Maybe you’d find happiness by, I don’t know, helping other people? That could be your new, uh, path. Hm. Say you could save a starving village by lending out the stick for… My stick? Okay. How about I rip off my tail and give that away too? I mean, come on. You could save the lives of so many. Hard pass. Me and Stick are meant for way bigger things. You wanna be happy, you help people. You can do great things. I’m just a mortal. You’re the only mortal I know who’s gone to hell and heaven in one day. That wasn’t my accomplishment. That was you. When we were in hell, I read my scroll. It said, “Lin, common peasant girl.” “Tried to make a difference. Never did.” [sighs] Does it have to end that way? I don’t know. Who’s Lin? I’m Lin. Oh! Hey, Lin. Monkey King. Nice to meet ya. Pleasure. Buck up, Lin. No one thought I could make a difference, right? But now look at me. The original outsider. Fully immortal! So don’t let anyone, god, demon, old monkeys, challenge you or stand in your way. You want something, don’t ask. Just take it. [Stick grunts] I’ve got a challenge. Go on. It’s a big one. I’m listening. How long do you think an immortal monkey can hold his breath under that water? Interesting. I dunno. Two, three years! [inhales deeply] [Stick murmurs] [Lin grunts] [strains] [soft music plays] Don’t be sad. You’ve done good, girl. Go home. Your storm is coming. [Babbo and Benbo laugh] [soft music continues] [Lin grunts] Ah, I wasn’t gonna make you wait the whole three. Forget it. Come on. Grab Stick, and we’ll… Where’s Stick? I had no choice. He just needs to borrow it. Borrow it? Where did you get that? The Dragon King just… Dragon King? My village is dying. My family is dying. The Dragon King can help them. I trusted you, Lin. I saved you. I saved you first. And I asked for your help. You said if I want something, don’t ask. Just take it. That’s what you said. [Monkey King growls] I had to do it. Ha! [yells] [dramatic music plays] [Dragon King laughs] [dramatic music continues] Well, hello, you. That stick belongs to me! Stickipoo here had a momentary fling, but now he’s come home. In fact, he’ll be the guest of honor at my celebration tonight. Invite only. And a warm thanks to you for the help, my child. Tell your village the drought is over. It’s all over. For you, your people, and the entire world! [Dragon King laughs maniacally] The world? No, we have to stop him. You betrayed me! I had no choice. We’re still family, right? I have no family. I’ll help you get Stick back. Help me? You? An insignificant pebble? This monkey heroes alone! [Lin gasps] [Lin yelps] [suspenseful music plays] [Monkey King grunts] I’ll show you crazy. Monkey! But he destroyed my home. Oh, Wangmu, if you can’t stop a little monkey from smashing your roof… [Jade Emperor yelps] [Babbo] Coming to the stage… [Benbo] To finally kick off his world domination tour… He’s flashy. He’s splashy. But don’t mention his rashy. [Benbo] Put your fins and tentacles together for… [Babbo and Benbo] The Dragon King!

Monkey King is my old title. You will address me as the Great Sage, equal of heaven! How can we show him he’s not the center of the universe? I got it! [deep voice] I have a challenge for you, Great Sage. Not interested! What is it? [Lin as Buddha] Something worthy of you. The ultimate challenge. [mysterious music plays] What gives? [Lin as Buddha] If you are powerful enough to leap from my palm, the kingdom of heaven will be yours to rule. Hang on. What did he just say? [deep voice] But if you fail, you will do a long penance here on Earth. Please. Too easy! [laughs] I just have to leave your hand?

Monkey King reigns supreme! [strains] [Buddha] When you awake to nothingness, you will have found your way. [Monkey King panting] Awake to nothingness. Whatever that means. I’ll think about it. [gentle music plays] He’s just a little monkey looking for a place to belong. [Buddha] The Monkey King’s scroll is still to be written. When he is ready, the world will need him as it has needed you.

[Lin] Monkey? Monkey. Go away! I’m busy thinking of all the ways to get back at you. Calmly. I came to say goodbye before Buddha closes up your mountain. Oh, lucky me. I know you’re mad, but you were out of control. [groans] Okay, you don’t have to remind me. Taking on all the gods probably wasn’t my best idea. [sighs] [groans] I really messed up, didn’t I? Monkey, you were born from a rock, abandoned by everyone. Th-The gods hated you, and all you ever wanted was to be loved. [gentle music plays] [Lin] And you are! You changed my life. I made a difference. We both did. I really am your number one fan. Well, I guess a little pebble did make a big wave. With an assist. Oh, that’s good. Me, your assistant? Ok',\n",

       "[['In the animated adventure Despicable Me 3, Felonious Gru and Lucy Wilde, married agents of the Anti-Villain League (AVL), are tasked with thwarting the plans of Balthazar Bratt, a former child star turned villain. After failing to secure Bratt and the stolen Dumont Diamond, they are unceremoniously fired from the AVL. Their personal lives are upended when most of their Minions leave, and Gru discovers he has a twin brother, Dru, who lives in wealth and wishes to become a villain like their father. As Gru grapples with his identity and reluctance to return to villainy, Bratt steals the diamond again to execute his revenge on Hollywood. The brothers eventually team up to stop Bratt, leading to a series of misadventures that test their bond, culminate in a dramatic rescue mission, and finally, bring the family closer together. Despite initial tensions and conflicts, the story ends on a high note with Gru and Lucy’s reinstatement into the AVL and a renewed sense of unity among the characters, setting the stage for further adventures. * * * Illuminat… (CHUCKLES) (CLEARS THROAT) Illuminat… (GIGGLES) Illuminat… (SPEAKING MINIONESE) (FARTS) (SNIFFS AND GROANS) (GIGGLES) Illumination! (FARTS) (GROANING) The year was 1985, and the number one show on TV was… Evil Bratt! HOST: The show starred young Balthazar Bratt as a child prodigy and criminal mastermind bent on world domination. (LAUGHING) There he is! Get him! (ALL GRUNTING) I’ve been a bad boy! Bratt was the biggest child actor of the 1980s, striking a chord with audiences all over the world. (BOTH CHEERING) (BALTHAZAR LAUGHING) There he is! Get him! HOST: But it all came to an end in Season 3, when… I’ve been a bad boy! HOST: The young star experienced an unexpected growth spurt. Boy? Ugh! The show was canceled. Hollywood rejected him and Bratt quickly plunged into a downward spiral, starting to actually believe he was the character he played on TV. What are you looking at? HOST: Leading us all to wonder, where is he now? (BALTHAZAR LAUGHING) (CHUCKLING) You know what, Clive? Playing a villain on TV was fun, but being one in real life is even better. Heist music! Here it comes. (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING) (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) What? Clive, what are you doing? How is that heist music? Sorry. My bad. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Ew! (GRUNTS) (GROANS) Mommy! Stop or I’ll… (GROANS) (ALARM BLARING) Sir, the ship has been boarded by some kind of monster! Wait! That’s not a monster. That’s a man wearing shoulder pads! There’s only one supervillain whose fashion sense is quite that dated. Balthazar Bratt. Blast it! The Dumont Diamond is on that ship. I want every agent in the area on the scene immediately!

You should be on TV. Oh, that’s right. You were! But then you got canceled! (CHUCKLES) Ha-ha! What about that? Ugh! What? Oh, girls! Oh! (GRUNTING) Dance fight! (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) (SCATTING) Ow! (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) Alpha Team, the diamond is secure. Come and pick up the package. ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Copy that. Alpha Team in approach. Gru! Did you actually think I was unconscious? Huh! It’s called acting, hoser. And clearly, I’ve still got it! (SCREAMING) (PLAYING KEYTAR) (GRU CONTINUES SCREAMING) I’ve been a bad boy! (CACKLES) ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Freeze! Don’t move!

How is this possible? How? (GRU LAUGHS) And it’s not just that he got away, it is he’s so smug about it. “Ooh, I’ve been a bad boy!” Gah! Edna, hey! Looking hot today. Got cats on you. And it was so humiliating, dangling there in the bubble-gum Speedo. And I didn’t have time to go to the gym this week, and I had a big breakfast. And was feeling a little bloated. You know what? He’s not even worth talking about. I don’t even want to waste another breath about the guy. And another thing! Next time I see Bratt, I will moonwalk all over his stupid face! (MIMICS DANCING) Thank you all for coming at such short notice. It is with great sadness that I inform you that, as of today, I am retiring as head of the AVL. (ALL GASP) Oh, no! Your new leader is coming directly from head office. Effective immediately. She is the very gifted, very ambitious, Miss Valerie da Vinci. As I look out over all your faces, I am flooded with so many memories. Oh, boy! This is a snooze fest! Excuse me, this is my last… Blah, blah, blah! We understand.

You’re making me nervous. How could you let Balthazar Bratt, the AVL’s most wanted villain, just get away? That is the opposite of what we do here! Okay, okay. Yes, maybe he got away. Again. But he didn’t get the diamond. And I am this close to bringing him in. This close. Huh. Interesting. You’re fired! (GASPS) What? That’s totally not fair. Gru is a great agent! You know what? If you fire him, you’re gonna have to fire me, sister-sister. And do you really wanna do that? Do ya? GRU: No, no, no! (BOTH SCREAMING) (GRU GRUNTING) Well, I guess she did. Honey, you didn’t have to do that. I know how much you love your job. Well, I love other things more. You know, we’re gonna have to tell the girls. Can you do it? The whole “mom” thing is still kind of new to me. Oh, sure. Huh? Psst! (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) (BOTH YELLING) Hello? (ALL CRYING OUT) (GIRLS CHUCKLING) GIRLS: Aloha! LUCY: Oh! This is unexpected. Well, you never got to go on a honeymoon, so… We made you dinner! It’s a luau! We got pineapples and coconuts and ukuleles! Oh! Yay! Yay! (SINGING IN MINIONESE) (CLEARS THROAT) The soup of the day.

I love the combination of gummy bears and meat. (SPUTTERS) I’m gonna hold it in my mouth. ‘Cause it’s so good, I don’t wanna swallow it. So, how was work? Ooh, did you take that guy down? Did anything explode? Well, actually, today, Lucy and I were invited to not work at the AVL anymore. (UKULELE STRING SNAPS) (GASPS) No! You got fired? Oh, no! No, no, no. (LAUGHS) Yes. (GIRLS GASP) But don’t worry. I’m sure we’ll get new jobs. Real soon. Even better ones. (SCOFFS) What’s better than being super-cool secret agents? Ooh, I know! You could gamble online! That’s what Katie’s dad does. Okay. We will definitely look into that. That’s a good suggestion. And let’s not go over to Katie’s house anymore. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hmm?

Well, I need to make sure it’s solid. Everything’s solid. I should know. My dad rebuilt this place himself. Wait, your dad did? Yes, with his bare hands, every brick and board.

Oh. He will never trust me to take over. Why didn’t you say that before? (CLEARS THROAT) Wait, does that mean you’ll tear up the tickets? I mean, I would, but I just sent them over to the processing department. (GROANS FRUSTRATEDLY) But I can take you there so you can plead your case.

I, uh, couldn’t catch him though. Water, always trying to water us down. He was a Water person, Dad, not just water. Ah, same thing. And why is water in pipes? City shut down years ago. There should be no water. (COUGHS) Dad! Bernie. We will get through this. Just like before. Before? There is a reason we left Fire Land. Oh, Ember, we loved it th',\n",

We put everything into it. (WIND HOWLING) But then a great storm came. (CRASHING) (SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING) All was lost for us. Your father understood we had to leave everything. Our home. It was the only way to create a better life. It was the last time your father ever saw his family. That is why we came here. To build all this.

So, make like a stream and flow somewhere else. Actually, Gale won’t be in today. She’s a huge airball fan and the Windbreakers are finally in the playoffs. Toot toot. (GROANS) Okay.

Look at the score, what do you think? Blow the ball, not the game! (LIGHTNING CRACKLES) (HUFFS) Yeah, so, uh, Gale. (CHUCKLES) My name is Ember Lumen. My family runs a Fire shop. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Wade wrote us a bunch of tickets yesterday… What kind of call was that? (SPECTATORS GROAN) Oh, Lumen? Yeah, a Fire shop with 30 citations. Thirty? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Anyway, friend, I was hoping we could work something out. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Come on, ref! Are your eyes in the back of your head? (SPECTATORS BOOING) (GRUNTS, GROWLS) Oh, no. Yeah, bummer. Oh, yeah. Okay, so, the 30 citations. Do you mind? There’s a game going on. Fireball. Fireball? Actually, I do mind. This is my life we’re talking about. Not just some game. Some game? This is the playoffs. So, forgive me if I don’t want to hear a sob story about the problems of some little shop. Well, that little shop matters way more than a bunch of overpaid cloud puffs blowing some ball around. I dare you, say “cloud puffs” one more time. Cloud puffs. (BOTH GROWL) WADE: Oh, no!

       "  'ah! Yeah! Yes! (CHUCKLES) Whoohoo! Oh. Whoohoo! What a comeback. Check out who found the gift shop. Whoo! I gotta admit, that was pretty cool. You can see why I can get all churned up, but as a cloud puff who used to come here with her dad, all these wins mean a little bit more. And as a fireball who’s supposed to take over her dad’s shop, I sure don’t want to let him down, and I could use a win, too. Now, I just got to stop water from coming in. Water? In Firetown? Yeah. Water was shut off to there years ago. Oh, forget the tickets, I’m gonna have to take apart your dad’s shop to figure out what’s going on. You can’t! My dad put his whole life into that place. (GRUNTS) I bet this is connected to that fluffing leak. Yeah, we’ve been trying to track down a leak in the city. It’s why I was in the canal and… Wait, I know where I got sucked into Ember’s shop. Ember and I could track the water from her shop to find the source of the leak. Keep talking. I could call in a city crew to fix whatever we find. Yes. And there’d be no need to touch my dad’s shop. You’re lucky you’re a cute couple. Oh, we’re not a… You got until Friday. If you can find the leak and get a crew to fix it by then, those tickets are forgiven. If not, your dad’s shop gets shut down. Whoohoo! Break wind! Break wind! Thank you. (SIGHS IN RELIEF, CHUCKLES) Please take all that off. But I got you a hat. (BOOM) Okay. EMBER: Just keep out of sight, okay? It’d be a whole thing. BERNIE: Now water upstairs? It’s in the walls. I don’t understand. I fix one pipe and another one leaks. (GROANS) Water! (COUGHING) How could it be worse? Now that the water’s back, the pressure is forcing it up to all your pipes. We gotta find the source. How did you even end up here? WADE: Well, I was in the canals checking the doors for leaks, when I found some water that shouldn’t have been there. Rusty with a hint of motor oil? There was this whoosh of water. (SCREAMS) And I got sucked into a filtering system. Help! (GRUNTS) But then I heard this explosion. (RUMBLING) (EMBER SCREAMING) (WADE SCREAMS) That’s how I ended up at your place. Oh, flame! My temper caused this. So, we’re searching for water somewhere in a canal? Those canals go everywhere. It’s why tracking down that leak has been so dang hard. The roof. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (YELPS) (GRUNTS) You might want to step back. (GRUNTS) (CAPTIVATING MUSIC PLAYING) Holy dew drop! Shh. Get in. (WADE GRUNTS) (FIRE ROARS) (CAPTIVATING MUSIC CONTINUES) (WATER BUBBLING) (STEAM HISSING) Okay, that’s where I got sucked in. More water. Go that way. (CHUCKLING) Yeah, right there. Mm. (LAUGHS) Oh! (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Nothing weird going on here. (IN SINGSONG) Uh, just a little pruning. (BOTH LAUGHING) (EMBER SNIFFS) So, uh, what do you do at the shop? If you don’t mind me asking. EMBER: My dad’s retiring and I’ll be taking over. Someday. When I’m ready. (SIGHS) WADE: It must be nice knowing what you’re gonna do. After my dad passed, I got all, “What’s the point?” Now I just go from one job to the next. There’s a word in Firish. (SPEAKING FIRISH) Tìshók. It means embrace the light while it burns because it won’t always last forever. (HALTINGLY) Teeshook. Or something like that. (CHUCKLES) You okay? Yeah. You sure? It’s just, that building over there, that’s Garden Central Station. When I was a kid, my dad took me there because they had a Vivisteria tree. I’d always wanted to see one. It’s the only flower tha',\n",
       "  't can thrive in any environment. Fire included. I was so excited. But they said our fire was too dangerous, and they wouldn’t let us in. (SHOUTS IN FIRISH) Go back to Fire Land. EMBER: My dad was so angry… Burn somewhere else! Get outta here! EMBER: …and embarrassed. The building flooded a few years later. So, I missed my one chance to see a Vivisteria. You must have been so scared. I was. (GROANS) How do you do that? Do what? Draw people in? You got a whole stadium to connect with you. I… I can’t even connect with one customer. My stupid temper always kicks in. I guess I just say what I feel. And I don’t think a temper is so bad. Sometimes when I lose my temper, I think it’s just me trying to tell me something I’m not ready to hear. That’s ridiculous. Maybe. Hey, there. Put us down there. (THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING) That’s not right. (SMACKS LIPS) Motor oil. Yup, this is the source. Why is there no water? Because the doors are broken. This is supposed to catch spill over from those main canals and… (SHIP HORN BLOWS) Run for your life! (WADE GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) Help! (SCREAMING) (WATER RUMBLING) Uh… (GRUNTS) Grab this!

So, will this hold? (GRUNTS) Yup. It should for sure. At least long enough for me to get a city crew to fix it before Friday. What? You’ve got a little (CHUCKLES) sand. Oh. Here? Here? It’s right there. Um… Oh. (BUBBLES) Thanks. Well, let me know when it’s done, I guess. I’ll make sure there’s a city crew here by Friday. Okay. See ya. Wait. Any chance you’re free tomorrow? (NERVOUSLY) To hang out with a Water guy? With a Water guy? My dad would boil you alive. He doesn’t have to know. We can meet in the city. I promise, nothing weird. Maybe a little pruning?

       " ['When Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) distinguishes himself as the postal academy’s worst student, he is stationed on a frozen island above the Arctic Circle, where the feuding locals hardly exchange words let alone letters. Jesper is about to give up when he finds an ally in local teacher Alva (Rashida Jones), and discovers Klaus (J.K. Simmons), a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys. These unlikely friendships return laughter to Smeerensburg, forging a new legacy of generous neighbors, magical lore and stockings hung by the chimney with care. An animated Christmas comedy directed by Despicable Me co-creator Sergio Pablos, Klaus co-stars Rashida Jones, Jason Schwartzman and JK Simmons. \\xa0 \\xa0 Letters. You don’t really write many these days, do you? But I bet there’s one you never forget. Send it off to a certain plump guy in a red suit and, provided you’ve kept your act together more or less, he’ll drop off a toy or two. And yet, no one seems to wonder how the whole thing got started in the first place. This is a story about letters, and it began… with this one. …74, 75, 76… 77, 78, 79, 80! Drill Sergeant, sir! All the way from the top! Dispatch for one of your cadets! It’s for him, sir. Cadet Johanssen! Mmm-mmm-mmm! Stop. Don’t tell me. Let me try to guess. I give up. Who are you? Sarge! Drill Sarge! Have a seat. Can I get you something to drink? An espresso? A cappuccino? Aren’t you supposed to be in equestrian training? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. No worries. I’ve got someone covering for me. Dispatch from the Postmaster General’s Office! What? Sarge, is that for real? Don’t tease me now. Here, hold these. Ah, well, I was expecting this a little bit sooner, but, yup, summoned to the dragon’s lair. Go ahead and cancel the Drill Sergeant’s espresso, actually. And, uh, here, why don’t you finish mine? I’m not gonna be needing it anymore…and I’m gonna take one last look around the old place so I can forget it. Mmm-hmm. Got it. All right, let’s go. Nine months. It’s been nine months since I used every ounce of my influence to get you into the Royal Postal Academy. Actually, nine months and six days, but who’s counting? What? No croutons? Oh, man, come on! Shall we take account of your progress then? Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Definitely. Sergeant. Yes, sir! Sorting and filing: total failure. Carrier pigeon care and handling… abysmal performance. Transport of fragile merchandise… worst on record. Well, there you have it. But, hey, we gave it the old college try, didn’t we? Guess I’ll just go pack up and head home then. Too bad. Darn, oh, darn. Stay right where you are. No, Dad! You’re right. When will I grow up? When will I stop squandering all these opportunities, which you so kindly forced me into, and become my own man? I guess I must really hanker down and rethink my priorities. All wrapped up in my silk sheets with some caviar and a sherry… You still buy the same brand, right? You think I’',\n",
       "  'm just going to watch you purposely fail and then let you waltz right back to a privileged life void of any purpose or meaning? Well, yeah. Where else would I… Congratulations. You are now a postman. Come again? You are to establish a working postal office in… Smeerensburg. You’ve got one year. What? A year? Where? Smeerensburg? What is… What’s happening right now? Dad? Six thousand letters will suffice. Stamped by your own hand. And listen carefully, Jesper. If you fail to get those letters, you’re cut off. No more fancy apartments, stagecoach, clothes, galas… All gone. You can look forward to a cozy spot in the gutter. But… Six thousand letters, one year. You can’t cheat, bribe or squirm your way out of this one. Dad! Come on! It’s me. Let’s talk about this, man. It’s your son, Jesper! Little Jespie! Remember, I… “Daddy, can I help you mail the letters? Can I help you put the medals in the letters and put them in a stamp with the…” W-w-wait! Do you know how long it took to press this uniform? I don’t either, but it took somebody hours. Hello? Burghard! Finally, a friendly face. Can you believe what they… Burghard, I’m not in the coach with you. Burghard? Sir, I’m all for discipline, but Smeerensburg? Isn’t that a bit excessive? That boy needs a wake-up call, Sergeant. And who knows? Someday he might even thank me for it. Thank you, Dad! This is really wonderful, Father. Thank you so much. This is great, Dad. Really, really great. Thanks, Dad! Thank you! I love this terrible coach ride. Thank you so much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank… You go back to the intersection. You make a left at the dead tree. You’re welcome. What? No. I’m not lost. Trust me, you are. Funny! Say, nice boat! Any chance you might actually get on it today? What was that? New postman. Smeerensburg. Which is on an island, which is surrounded by water, which I need a boat to get to, which you have. Are we starting to connect the dots? Is the weather always like this? Eh. We’re having a bit of a heat wave. Huh? There she is. Smeerensburg. Charming, huh? Why, you should see it in the spring. That’s when those grays really pop. What happened here? Oh! Uh, colorful local traditions. Quirky folklore. That kind of thing. All part of this quaint town’s vibrant culture. No, no! Why you… Oh, you rotten vermin! Where is everyone? Everyone? I thought there would be some sort of a reception. Oh! Right. Right, the reception. Of course, the reception. It’s good you reminded me. You just ring the bell over there and, uh… and then the reception will start. The bell? Yep. Give it a go. And they’ll come out. Why, they’ll have a band, hors d’oeuvres and, uh… and the key to the city. All that reception stuff. Really? Out here? Why, of course! Well, it’s not every day they get a brand-new postman from the big city. Huh? What’s happening? Whoa! Whoa! Aah! Ow, they’re biting! Ow, get off! Get off! Get off! Isn’t this nice? And you thought they forgot',\n",
       "  '. Quick! Get me out of here! Uh… What’s going on out here? Why is everybody just standing around? Well! Look who’s finally throwing in the towel! Throwing in the… Us? Ha! That’s rich! Admit it! You weaseled out and rang the bell! An Ellingboe? Never! It was one of you critters! Don’t you dare raise your voice at me! Oh, there you go! You rang that bell! You know you rang… Oh! You chicken out, and now you want to pin it on us! Unbelievable! We were plowing the snow… Oh, whoa! Hey! Huh. What’ve you got there, children? Mine! Pumpkin, show Daddy what you found. Mine. This is no way to treat a person! Certainly not this person! Just one second. Let me just… A postman? Pfft. Give me a break. When will they learn? Hey! They’ve sent us another postman! All right. All right. You don’t know who I am, so I’m gonna let this one slide. Okay? But let’s just say I’m not really a postman. Well, I am, because it’s our family business. My father’s a… Don’t get me started, because it’s… Where were we? Oh, yeah. Bell, please! Life is too short to go into details, but… Come to the counter. I’ll be right out. All right, listen. Whoever’s there, I warn you, you do not want to mess with me. Okay? Holy mackerel! Oh, the smell! Fresh out of mackerel. Only herring and burbot today. Oh. Oh. Uniform, cold sweat, scared stiff, shaking in your boots. All right, I’m gonna just take a wild guess here. You are the latest mailman, and the ferryman tricked you into ringing the Battle Bell. The Battle Bell? What kind of a town has a Battle Bell? Can we open a window in here or something? I can’t pretend any… Welcome to Smeerensburg, home of the world’s finest feuds. Feuds? Grudges, bickering, the Krums versus the Ellingboes. So… are you gonna buy something, or are you just here to chitchat? Wait. Isn’t this a school? Shouldn’t there be children and a teacher? Oh! Yes! Oh, thank you! Thank you! I knew I was forgetting something! Children! Thank you! You’re the teacher? Okay, here’s how it works. I sell fish, and then the person on the other side of the counter… That would be you. You buy… Holy moly! That’s you? What happened? What happened was… That’s… That came out wrong. I took a teaching job at a place where people don’t send their kids to school! Mingling with their sworn enemy’s spawn? Oh, no! We can’t have that! So, now I’m reduced to doing this so I can get some money and start fresh somewhere far, far away from here. Are you going to buy something? Herring’s on sale today. Ah! There you are. I wondered where you’d scurried off to! Morning, Miss. Alva. Mogens. Come on, sport! I saved the best for last! Home sweet home. Ow! What the… Mail that, postman! Now wait a minute, that’s completely… Go home, you loser! Oh, yeah? Well, if I’m a loser, then you’re a, uh… You’re too far. You’re gone. Well, lots of nice, natural light, rustic touches, central air and panoramic views. Perfect for animal lovers. Enjoy. Wait! Wait! This can’t be right!',\n",
       "  ' I… Oh, I get it. Did my father put you up to this? Good one. Ha ha. You got me. Okay, well, enough of that. Show me where I’m really staying. I’d like a hot bath and a look at the dinner menu. Here, let me help you out. You’re a postman in Smeerensburg, which is on an island cut off from the world, frigid cold, angry, violent neighbors, and this is home now. Are we starting to connect the dots? Aah! Ugh. Almost. Hang in there. What? Hmm? Oh. Aah! That’s it! This place is the worst! I’m going home! No! You can’t leave, remember? You’ll be broke! Out in the streets! But I hate it here! It’s so cold and icky! And the people are mean to me. And I miss my silk sheets. Shut up! Stop being weak! Focus! How do you get out of here? You need… You need… letters! Ugh. All right. This is a good one. I can feel it. Come to Papa, you sweet, sweet little… Oh, come on! Ugh! Pssh! Fine. Go to the source, I guess. Good morning, madame. I’m the postman, obviously. If you have letters you’d like me to send, you could go scurry ahead and get them and… Hello! Hi! Hi! If you have your letters on you, I’d be glad to take them off your… Hmph! Birthday cards? Distant cousin? Deceased notice? Holy mother! Any letters… or packages? Any packages? Come on, people! Letters! Letters! I don’t have all day! Okay, keep low. Don’t panic. Don’t panic. Oh, I guess that’s why they call it “snail mail.” All right. What’s going on here? Where are all the letters? Oh. Folks around here only have one thing to say to one another. Ah. And they’re getting their point across pretty well without mail. Wouldn’t you say? Wait, wait, wait. No letters? But how am I supposed to get out of… What the… Hello? Sir, can I get my drawing back? The wind blew it away. Please? Not now, kid. Can’t you see I’m busy trying to figure out how to get… Well, here’s a thought. I’m a postman, see? So I can’t give it to you, but I could mail it to you. How? Couldn’t be simpler! I just fold your pretty drawing, very beautiful by the way, put it in an envelope like this and then all that’s left is postage so I can put it in the mailbox for you. – Postage? – Yep. You just toss a penny over to me so I can stamp it, and we’re all ready to go. Couldn’t you just put it in? Aw. Tsk. I really, really would, but I can’t. It’s not a letter if it doesn’t have postage. See how it works? So what do you say? I get my letter, and you get your drawing. Win-win. You want your drawing, don’t you? – Um… – If you don’t, I’m gonna keep it. – Hmm. – I love it. I would keep it if I was you, so I would send this letter back to myself if I was you. Oh, hi, Papa! This nice man says he can mail my drawing back to me! – He’s lying. Children are liars. – Can you give him a penny? Oh, look at that. Wrong address. Silly me. These aren’t… You’re not the Spendlebergs. I’ll see you later. Thank you so much, and no need… Aah! The puppies! The puppies! Ah. And that must be the express mail. All right, Smeerensbur',\n",
       "  'g. You may have won this round, but if you think I’m giving up, think again. I’ll have my letters in no time, and then it’s bye-bye to you and your cold and your loons and your chickens! That’s right! You too! You’ll see. I give it a week. Two, tops. Is this a bad time? I can see you’re pretty swamped. Don’t you have… a job or something? Why, sure I do. I’m here to pick up all the outgoing mail. So, where is it? Now, you’re gonna have to help me with the heavier bags. Bad back, don’t you know. – Man, I hate you. – I know. So, uh, where is the mail, anyway? Where do you keep it? In a different room now or something? What about if I walk around the room, if I get close to the mail, you say “warmer”? And if I’m getting farther from the mail, you say “colder”? – And then… – What’s that? What? Oh, the woodsman’s cabin? Yeah, does someone live there? Well, sure. Yeah, you should definitely drop by. Nice fella. Loves visitors. Hello? I’m in your house or… whatever this place is. Anybody here? Ah, come on. Really? Of course. Of course this would happen. Great. I’m gonna kill that boatman. What? Toys? Ah, here we go. Now I can go home with the satisfaction of having accomplished absolutely… Aah! Aah! Aah! Yeehaw! That’s it! I’ve had it! Better alive in the gutter than hacked into pieces! No, thank you! Yah! Please don’t chop me up and scatter my parts in the woods! Where’s this? What? I don’t know. How would I… Wait. I do know. Keep going down this road, and you’ll get there. You can’t miss it. It… Or I can show you. Sure. Yeah, let me just show you. All right. Excuse me. Just… Can I… Here we are. Watch your step getting out of the, uh… What’s this? You’re a postman, aren’t you? Oh, you want me to… No, but I… Sure thing. My pleasure. Nothing I’d love to do more than deliver what I’m fairly certain can only be a severed head of some kind. I mean, there’s no way that’s not a severed head. It’s gotta… I’m holding a head in my hand, but hey! Come on! Look, I’m… Ah! You’re right there! So quiet for a disproportionately… I mean, strapping, uh… statuesque. You have a kind of, um… What? In there? You must be kidding. No way. Absolutely not. I mean, first of all, I’d love to, of course, but, look, too bad about the fence. Rats. Oh, well. What are you gonna do? Are you… What’s happening right now? Hey, listen, please. Open this! Why are you doing this to me? Oh, no. Okay, you win. What do you want? Money? My dad’s got plenty of it. You can write him a ransom note. You can write, right? Oh, it doesn’t matter. I’ll write it for you. Ah! He’ll never know it’s me! I’ll make it sound like it’s from you! I’ll use monosyllabic words, man! Please! Please! Please! Just let me out of here! I’m gonna get… Why? Ow! Ow! Who’s there? Aah! Door, door, door. Locks! This has gotta move! Come on! Come on! Open up. Open up. Open up! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Keep it together!

Are you in there? Go away! Go! Leave! He’ll hear you! We’d like to send these letters! What? What did you just say? Our cousin told us if we write a letter to Mr. Klaus, he’ll make us a toy. He also said to bring you a penny each. It’s not a letter if it doesn’t have postage, right? – Psst. Hey. Hey, you. – Hmm? You want a toy? Hey! Would you, uh… like a brand-new toy? Just write a letter to Mr. Klaus. And you put it in the envelope, write your name on it and bring a penny. Can’t forget the penny. These better sound sad. Do they sound sad? Okay, good job. All right. And now… for the tricky part. All right. Remember… probably not an ax murderer, though… it still is a possibility, but most likely… no. He’s a good guy… deep down. Hello. Hello. Mr… Klaus, I take it? You remember me from the nice breaking and entering last night? Jesper Johanssen, postman, but we never properly… Uh… I, uh… You see, Mr. Klaus, it seems like word got around that the poor children of Smeerensburg have started, uh… completely unprompted… writing letters asking you for… toys. So I figured you have the whole barn filled with toys just sitting there collecting dust, so… Oh, God. Okay. This is it. Here it goes. Oh, wow. That is… totally normal. Not a symptom of any mental illness or anything. – Go away. – Mr. Klaus, sir! Those little children… …if you donate your old toys to them… …well, I’ll gladly deliver them for free! Mr. Klaus, wait! Please! Think of all the joy you’ll bring their miserable little lives! Look, here. Poor little Herlief. He only has sticks and stones to play with. So sad. And this one, little Penny… Patty. Her doll was so old, it crumbled in her arms when she came to me. And then Kristoff… Little, ugly Kristoff. This little… Tonight, same time. Great! What, “same time”? You mean, dead of night? – I can just take the toys now. – No. I go with you. There’s no need for you to come with me, really. It might be against the law for a noncertified postman to ride with me. I have to check the rule book. Great. Tonight, then. I’ll see you then. Good talk. Good talk. Whoa! Whoo! Huh? Oh, oh! Playing! Playing, I tell you. With an Ellingboe! – An Ellingboe, no less! – In all my years! – Did you all hear that? – Unacceptable. I don’t know how it happened. I turned away for one second… And then I saw it. I brought her as soon as I could, sir. – That’s just wrong! Wrong, I say! – Inconceivable! – What are we going to do? – Unthinkable! Hmm. This is bad. Very bad. Worst I’ve ever seen, really. What were you thinking, kid? Don’t you know that… Krums and Ellingboes don’t mix. – But why? – “Why?” he asks! – See what I mean? – Why? I don’t know what to do! Please help us, miss! I beg you!

Now, I just know you didn’t mean to disrespect all of that heritage, right? – Right. – And it won’t happen again, will it? Of course not. Now, tell me all about where this pretty thing came from. Ugh. Let me guess. Leaving it at the gate not an option? You really have a way with words, you know? Of course, you don’t… Of course, don’t even answer that… I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

The rest, you know the deal. No letter, no toy. But we don’t know how to write. Tough luck, kid. Wait, you know what you could do? – What are you doing? – Aah! Telling children to go to school to learn to write? What is wrong with you? Yeah, yes. What I meant to do… Listen to me, Postman. Whatever you’re doing, leave me out of it. I have been rotting away here for five years, and I am so close to getting out. I am not about to let you mess it all up. You got it? These children wasting away without a proper education? I mean… Forgive me, I’m kind of a dreamer, but… isn’t that why we do it? Hmm? Hmm? Why you became a teacher? So you could make a difference? Ah. Young love. Takes me back, you know?

He’s huge, but he can squeeze down any chimney! – Really? How? – I don’t know. Magic, I guess. Ow! There. Ugh. If you leave your socks hanging on the mantle, Mr. Klaus will fill them with toys! He only comes when you’re sleeping. No one has ever seen him. It’s like he’s invisible or something. Aah! Oh, and he likes cookies. Don’t forget to leave out some cookies. Go home, you loser! Hmm.

But less presents means less letters, and less letters means less… more children’s dreams being shattered. No. No, no, no, I won’t allow it. We have a sworn duty for the children. Aah! Gotcha! Aah!

Thank you! Hi, Mr. Postman! “Miss. Alva is the best teacher ever!” “Also, I cleaned my dad’s old clarinet. I hope I did a good job. He seemed happy. Could I get a toy please?” Huh? Huh? What? What the… Hey, there, Chief. How’re we doin’… – Here! Me! – What? How? Whoo! Come on, guys! Let’s play! I think it’s time we send that postman… a message. You know what to do, pumpkin. Mine… And the baker now has a sale on cakes for Ellingboes, without razor blades in the dough or anything. Oh, and did you know that arson is down 70%? It’s true. When’s the last time you saw a house burn down? Precisely. And cookouts, swap meets, and, uh… yeah, I don’t know. It’s like everyone’s gone mad or something. A true selfless act… always sparks another. Well, look who’s suddenly a chatterbox. Tell me, what made you squander all those words into that nugget of wisdom? Oh, just something… someone used to say. Well, let me tell you something. I’ve been around long enough to know that everyone is out to get something. Those kids? Those kids are in it for the toys. And the grown-ups? Well, I don’t know what they’re after. but it sure is not goodwill and peace on Earth. What about you? – What’s in it for you? – Me? Well, you know… It’s different. I don’t… Look out! – Mine! – What? Aah! – I can’t believe this! – Whoa! What are you doing at our ambush? Your ambush? This is our ambush! – Stop, stop, stop! – I’m trying! Stop! Stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, great! Look what you’ve done! – What we’ve done? – Leave it to you… Whoa! Wow. Friends of yours, I take it? Uh… They seem nice. You guys are not gonna believe what I saw last night! A flying sleigh pulled by magical reindeer? Yep. Oh, look, it can laugh. – Ho ho ho! – Mystery solved. Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Wait, wait, wait. Time out. Really? – That’s how you laugh? – Right. Let’s load up. Oh, no, no. You don’t get off that easy. – Let me hear it again. – No. Come on. Just a snicker or a chuckle. – Just a giggle. – Keep it up. See what happens. All right. I’ll stop. Say, have you heard the one about the one-legged man who walks into a bar? Say, we’re kinda running low on inventory, aren’t we? Yes, only a couple more trips, and that should do it. You must be… looking forward to no more night shifts. – Right? – Right. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Hello, Postman! Oh, good, you’re back. Yes, yes, yes. That’s very nice, but whatever it is you’re saying, I’ve got my own problems, you know? I mean, we are out of toys, and without toys, there are no letters. And without letters… Ugh! Forget it. I’m running out of time! There, I said it! It’s almost Christmas already, and I still… Christmas. Christmas. That’s it. Wait. We gotta do… I gotta… Can you please get off my porch? You’re trespassing. ',\n",

Yeah, I… Of course I know. Uh… – Midnight brawl? – Look around, Aksel! Where is your clan? – Huh. – I’ll tell you where they are. They’re at block parties! Hayrides! And cookouts! Brunches! Don’t forget about the brunches. It was a book club that took my poor Sven! You see? The postman and that old toy maker are brainwashing everyone! What’re you saying? I’m saying it’s time to join forces against a common enemy. I’m saying we need a truce. A truce? Have you gone mad? Either we band together to take care of this, or it’s gonna be all book clubs – and cookouts from here on… – And brunches! – Don’t forget about the brunches. – Yes, that… that too. So, we must join together in peace to help stop this peace? Our ancestors demand it. For the Ellingboe bloodline! For the Krums’ honor. The clans are on the warpath… together! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! I… This is gonna take a lot of work. – Surprise! – Oh!

I promise. Christmas! Christmas? What do you… Think about it! Every child in town gets up on Christmas morning and finds a… brand-new toy waiting for them by the fireplace. We can make the holiday even more magical. Think of the joy. Think of the happiness. Jesper, listen. I don’t think… Puh-puh-puh! Let me finish. Let me finish. Think of all those happy little faces, huh? They’re so cute! They’re just… Aww! – Aren’t they so… Look! – Even if we… Where are you gonna get that many toys? You… make new ones! I don’t make toys. Not anymore. Pfft. You… You have a gift, my friend. Birdhouses are nice and all, but come on! Those hands were meant – for making… – I said no. Come on! Work with me here. Picture the possibilities. Look, woodwork would go here. No. And here, clockwork with all the gears and the cogs, – for you to tinker with all day. – Stop it.

Bad night, huh? Ugh. Well, join the club. Nah, I don’t want to bore you with it. Well, okay. It’s just been bothering me, you know? If I don’t get those letters, then what am I supposed to do? Stay in this little town forever, hanging out with an old woodsman, surrounded by crazy people, and never wanting anything more? Back home, I’ve got pretty much everything.

And speaking of the future, I look forward to discussing… One down, one to go. If you ask me “who” right now, I swear! Well, now, finally leaving, aren’t we? I… uh… Anchors away, Captain. – We’re sailing off at once. – Well, that’s a first. I beg your pardon? Never saw a postman looking more miserable leaving than on the day they came in. Oh, well.

Jesper! So I told him. I told him everything. And then he turned to me, and he said… …he’d never been more proud of me. And he hugged me. Can you believe that? I thought he’d be mad. Well, yeah, sure. I’ll miss it. The big house, the having my every whim tended to, the silk sheets. Oh, God, the silk sheets! Can we change the subject? Anyways, anybody can get off a boat.

Nothing to it. Just… I wouldn’t be so sure. Wait! No, no, no! No! No, no, no! No! This town was built on resentment and spite. And it’ll stay that way as long as a Krum… Or an Ellingboe! Ugh. …have something to say about it. Let’s go. We’re done here. Well said. Wait, does that mean the feud is back on? No more truce? First thing tomorrow. A true act of goodwill. What was that?

It’s Mama calling. – Put the boy down. – Remember Mama? You don’t know where he’s been. Klaus, I don’t know what to say. If I hadn’t… What’s this? The presents in the sleigh were all fake? Give me a little credit. I wasn’t going to let them have the toys. – But how did you know that… – Kids talk, you know? And if kids happen to be talking about their parents plotting to form an angry mob, then, you know, teachers listen. It was a simple plan. They would destroy the decoys and leave. But then you showed up and made it complicated. As usual. So, all this was for nothing? Oh, I wouldn’t say that. Shall we then? He came! He came! – Yeah! – Mine’s the big one! I told you!

And Smeerensburg continued to change for the better. Poetic, don’t you think? As for Alva and I… well, what’d you expect? Of course she loved me. Every year, come the Christmas season, the letters started pouring in. More and more each time, and from farther away. We did have to expand the operation, just like we had planned. More children, more toys, more towns. It’s so bright you can even see at night. Oh, look over there! See the red and yellow along the rim? The years went by. Any chance for a hot cup of coffee for your neighborhood mailman? What is on your face? What? You don’t like it? I think it looks good on me, don’t you? Be honest. Alva hates it.

Yes, first, they start spending less time with you. TIM: Mm. Then they stop coming to you for advice. Exactly. Soon, they take you for granted. I guess. Then break your arm. What? Then stuff you into a box! Okay. Wizzie, you’re… you’re not helping. (Wizzie scoffs) Okay, I’m just… I’m afraid Tabitha and I are growing apart, like… like I did with my brother. Oh.

And that day is coming sooner than you think. Hello. My name is Dr. Erwin Armstrong, founder of The Acorn Center for Advanced Childhood. Wait a minute, that’s… that’s Tabitha’s school. Here at the center, we believe babies are the ultimate learning machines. Isn’t that right, little Nathan? Yeah! (chuckles): Okay. They should use their precious time to develop faster, push harder. Hmm. (Tim scoffs) Parents, they have the best intentions, of course, but they’re not experts. After all, the only thing holding your child back is… you. KIDS: You! This explains why Tabitha’s been pulling away from me. It’s the school. ARMSTRONG: Everybody, wave. Bye, Mommy. KIDS: Bye, Mommy! Bye, Daddy. Bye, Daddy! (singsongy): Sayonara. Now, in the past six months, these schools have been popping up all over the world. Uh, so what’s the problem? The school is the problem. Yeah. School is evil. No, Daddy, not all schools are evil. It’s just this one, okay? Okay. If Armstrong’s philosophy keeps spreading, it could be the end of childhood. No. Childhood was the worst three years of my life. That’s so sad. You probably just didn’t do it right. Huh? Aw. But luckily, you get a do-over. A second chance. BabyCorp has developed a new super-duper baby formula that can turn a grown-up back into a baby. (baby coos) We have it in cherry, grape, orange and lime. For real? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You want me to be a baby? Hey, it’s what you do best. So you can infiltrate the school and find out what Dr. Armstrong is really up to. BabyCorp will take care of the rest. (whoops) (Tim gasps, laughs) It’s the perfect disguise.

Anybody else? Right here. Max Planck. (bell dings) ARMSTRONG: That’s correct. Tabitha has set the bar. First one on the board. Ding, ding, ding. Way to go, Tabitha. You’re going down, Templeton. Bring it on, Nathan. Yeah, Tabitha. Get him. ARMSTRONG: Next subject. Ancient Greek. STUDENTS: Opa! Oprah! (chuckles) (laughter, babbling) Attention. Attention, everyone. Who wants to play Shawshank? No! BABIES: Huh? Who wants to go outside and play? (cheering) Does that sound fun? Good. Now, anybody have any ideas? BABY: No! Come on, people. Think, think, think, think, think. We need to think outside the box. Oh, oh, oh! Me, me! Oh! You, Bo-Peep. We can build a hot-air balloon out of Popsicle sticks and bubble gum! (laughing) And how would it fly? Pixie dust!

ARMSTRONG: Once again, Tabitha’s on the board. Very good. Yes, Tabitha! (applause) We got 15 minutes, people. The difference in “try” and “triumph” is just a little oomph. BABIES: Oomph! Go big or go home. Okay. Going home. Let’s pick up the pace. No! Hand downs, Norma Rae. This is my time. To be, or not to be? Tabitha. To be. That’s correct. (bell dings) Can anyone tell me the horsepower of a 302 engine? Uh, seven? (buzzer sounds) ARMSTRONG: Oh, boy. Weak sauce, Nathan. That was weak.

What are you saying, there’s not enough evidence, BabyCorp? I… Uh-oh. So you’re not gonna do anything? But, BabyCorp, I… Ugh. Well, then we’ll take care of it. You know what, BabyCorp? I quit!

We have to stop Armstrong before the formula wears off. Working as a team, we will strike at the pageant. Go, Tina. Now, this top secret document… Sweetie, it’s the program. This top secret program reveals that Armstrong is scheduled to address the audience, which he will do right here at the very end. We need someone backstage. Tim, that’s you. How am I gonna get backstage if I’m not in the pageant? TED: My people will take care of that. (toy squeaks) Ah! Thank you. (chuckles) Thank you. No! Great. And… go. (laughing) Glue. (screams) ROBOT VOICE: There, there. All better. Awesome. Now, I’ll be your eyes an',\n",

It’s called a GAGA device. Aw, that’s cute. Check it out. (speaks gibberish) (over GAGA): Can you hear me, Daddy? Also cute. Meanwhile, with my new purple status, I can stay close to Armstrong. Um, that’s-that’s an eyebrow. Oh. Sorry. Uh, no, that’s, uh… TED: When the moment is right, I’ll implant a device. Got it. Got what? I mean, you’ve got this. Go get ’em, tiger. (chuckles) Oh, thank you, parents. (applause) Thank you. There’s the… There’s the old enthusiasm I like to see. TINA: This will allow me to control his suit. I can make Muttonchops do whatever I want. (babbling) TINA: I can make him dance. I can make him prance. Hey, no, no, no, no. Including exposing himself to the audience. (audience gasps) (screams) Every parent will pull out their phone. Don’t look at me. Don’t look at me! The photos will spread like a diaper rash. Cut to our pizza party. Boom! Bam! Poo! Poof! Questions? After Tabitha sings her solo, right? After Tabitha sings. Now we just sit back, relax and enjoy the show. (fanfare playing) ARMSTRONG: Welcome, parents, to our holiday pageant. Remember, flash photography in the auditorium is absolutely okay. Take a picture. Show your kids that you love ’em. Yippee! Come on, Tim. You promised you’d be here. (man groans) Oh, sorry. This seat is taken. Yep. Sorry. Oh, no. (mutters) So sorry. I… Sorry. (man grunts, mutters) Sorry! I am so sorry. (speaking gibberish) (over GAGA): Uncle Teddy, are you in position? The baby’s in the cradle. The baby’s in the cradle. Mmm. (slurping) (speaking gibberish) (over GAGA): Papa Bear, can you read me? The flake has landed. Places! Places, everybody! Here we go.

I’m talking about B-Day. B-Day? Oh, yeah. It’s already in the parents’ phones. (coughs) I taught babies to code. TED: Apps. They’re writing apps. But my next app… ooh, it’s gonna change the world forever. QT Snap is the app that’s going to change the world forever? Forever starts today. (chuckles) Uh, cool.

Yang) and his magical fighting Stick on an epic quest for victory over 100 demons, an eccentric Dragon King (Bowen Yang), and Monkey’s greatest foe of all —his own ego! * * * [mysterious music plays] [narrator] For thousands of years, Buddha oversaw the universe. And the Immortal Ones in heaven and kings in hell watched over earthly affairs. Demons walked among us, and dragons ruled the sea. Everything was in balance.

[squeaks] [jaunty music plays] [giggles] Okay, okay. Attention, everyone. We have important business to discuss. I, your Jade Emperor, Architect of the Universe and Lord of the Immortals, shall throw the greatest, most fantastic banquet since the one we did last Tuesday. Doesn’t that sound fun, hmm? Understood, Your Majesty. Now, seating arrangements. Place the Immortal Ones at my head table. Minor gods by the kitchen in the back… [Jade Emperor yells] [cat meows] [cat meows] [monkey screeches] What on Earth?

That rebel is me! My gorgeous machine will unleash the column’s power to create the greatest storm the world has ever seen. [tranquil music plays] Wow! [column hums] You talk? [humming continues] You’ve been waiting for me? How long? [column hums] Well, five minutes isn’t… Five thousand years? The days when sea creatures are looked down upon by those air-breathing dry-landers are over! [creatures chatter] [tranquil music continues] [column hums] You’re looking for the most powerful being? No way! I’m actually on a quest for the ultimate weapon! What are the odds, man? [column hums] There’s gotta be some way we can help each other. If you were just a little smaller, maybe I could… Oh, whoa! Let our conquest begin! But first, a song. And five, six, seven, eight! Huh? Whoa! Is this part of the show? What is happening? [henchman 2] Look out! [Dragon King] Someone’s stealing the grand column! Is that a monkey? [tense music plays] [monkey laughs] Whoa! You are incredible! [dramatic music crescendos] [cuttlefish] Excuse me, sire, but… Zip it. I have a call to make. [jaunty music chimes] [serene music plays] I demand satisfaction. Oh, it’s you. What is it? I’m busy. A monkey stole my grand column. So? So? Someone could do a lot of damage with that thing. Theoretically. You’re a king. You handle it. I believe in you. Perhaps you could escalate this to the big guy? Delegate up? Ah, let’s see. “Dear Buddha.” “Remember that stone monkey you said to leave alone?” “Well, it took a stick. We’re all scared. Please save us.” No. Not happening. Very well. I shall take things into my own claws, and woe to those that… Oh! Ugh! So it’s the monkey who’s the mightiest, fiercest rebel. With the best style. Yeah. And he swiped the one thing you need to take over the world. What a guy! [growls] [cuttlefish] Oh no! Any other comments? Input? Friendly feedback? Not me. Mm-mm. Nope. No? Then draw me a bath!

Oh yeah. So definitely not that tree. Yes, exactly that tree. But that tree’s not white. It’s more of a brown. No, not the color! I lit it up for you. See? Still nothing? So, it’s a glowing t',\n",

Knock my head off. What? Take my stick and whack me in the face. It’s all right. Come on, come on. Do it. I won’t even feel it. [groans] Fine. I’ll do it myself, wuss. [Lin snarls] Ow! Those peaches were defective. Maybe they’re out of season. What? Our quest has failed, Stick. [Stick groans] [groans] You’re still half-immortal. I don’t do half-things. Yeah, I noticed. [sighs] This old geezer once told me all the things I couldn’t do. That I’d wind up alone. Yeah. “You’ll never amount to anything.” I heard that all the time back home. [sighs] Wow. Wish I could relate. Well, thanks for your help. I mean, it was mostly me. You’re leaving? It was nice knowing you, little girl. But no! [grunts] Don’t go. You said we were family. No, I didn’t. You did. Doesn’t sound like me. Well, you said it. That was just the peaches talking. But you promised we’d do big things. We can’t give up now. “We”? Who’s this “we”? I’m still gonna join the Immortal Ones. Just not with you. [Lin groans] You know what? I’m starting to think that wasn’t even the real peach orchard. What? [laughs awkwardly] You think I… I deliberately brought you to ',\n",
       "  'the wrong place? L-L-Like some sort of… Like some sort of trap? You’re saying I lied to you? I’m not not saying it. You know what? Go ahead. Walk away. You’re so selfish. You only care about yourself. Well, no one else will. Ugh! ‘Cause you won’t let them. Someday, you really will end up all alone. [gentle music plays] Hm. Hm. [Stick murmurs] What are you yapping on about? [Stick murmurs] Who’s that? Assistant, what does it say? “An authority on everlasting life, the royal sorceress, Wangmu, can often be found in her laboratory brewing her famous Elixir of Immortality.” We’re back in the game! One sip and they’ll have to accept me. Way to go, Stick! Mwah! You too, Pebble. What are we waiting for? But that’s in heaven. Monkey King reigns supreme! [Lin yells] Is that the Jade Palace? Absolutely. [Monkey King grunts] [Lin screams] [exciting music plays] [Monkey King] Woo-hoo! What the… [Lin screams] [exciting music fades] [Lin] There she is. Wangmu. [Wangmu grunts] The queen of heaven. Yeah, whatever. Let’s go make me immortal. [Lin grunts and groans] [Monkey King grunts] [mysterious music plays] [whimpers] [Monkey King grunts] Locked. Oh! [Monkey King laughs] No. No, no, no! Monkey! Somewhere in this room are the ingredients for making the Elixir of Immortality. Guess I’ll just have to taste everything. No. No. Wait. First thing we need is… Here goes nothing. Hey, don’t drink that. I’m just smelling it. [Lin] Don’t smell anything. [Stick murmurs] Uh, Monkey? [Monkey King screeches] [Lin yelps] [pots smash] Hey! [Monkey King laughs] [Monkey King shrieks] [Lin gasps] Ooh. Wha… Wha… Huh? [Monkey King shrieks] [Lin growls] [Monkey King laughs] Huh? [Monkey King shrieks] [Monkey King whimpers] [whimpering continues] [grunts] Okay, Lin. You got this. Don’t look back. Don’t look back. Don’t… look… back. [Monkey King bawls] [Lin groans] [Monkey squeals] Oh! [laughs] Aw, you’re just a scared little monkey. No friends. No family. You are alone. [Monkey King mewls] [sad music plays] Sorry, Monkey. I can’t fool around anymore. My people are counting on me. [Monkey King whimpers] Oh! Oh! Agh! Gee, why’d you trash this place? We’re guests here. [Lin groans] Show a little respect. Immortality Elixir? Hello? Come on. I’m not paying you to goof around. Yeah. Uh-huh. We’re not actually paying her, are we? [Stick hums] Right. The first ingredient is… There. A pinch of instant karma. Get mixing. [woman] Stealing from an old lady? You have no honor. Uh-oh. [laughs] First, I punish you. Then I shame you. You can’t shame me. I have no shame. And you have no exit. Don’t worry, kid. I’ll take care of her. Eat lightning, chimp! [laughs] Immortality Elixir! Let’s go! [Monkey King grunts] [Wangmu] Ha! [grunts] A spoonful of chi. There! The blue jar. A spoonful of chi coming up. [Wangmu grunts] [Lin gasps] [exciting music plays] [Monkey King] What’s next? A drop of moon essence. The green jar. Bad monkey! [Monkey King] On it. Ha! Missed! Yes! Hee-yah! That’s it. [Monkey] What else? Last one. Nectar of peach. Yes! Um… Yes! [Wangmu growls] Here you go. [Wangmu] This is going to sting! [laughs] You call yourself a god? I’m so disappointed. What a bummer. [Wangmu yells] Um, it’s stuck! I-I need a spoon or chopsticks or… Stick, help her. [Stick yells] Perfect. [Monkey King] Ha ha! [dramatic music plays] I think I did it! Taste this. [grunts] Right. Taste death! Agh! No! [gasps] That does it! [grunts] [both grunt] [Monkey King] Nice punch, Grandma! Your friend’s not here to protect you now. [laughs] Uh, we’re not friends. I’m his assistant. His what? [screams] I’m just a pebble. [Lin screams] I’m only after his stick. I need it to save my village from a drought. So, the thief’s assistant is also a thief. [laughs] [Monkey King] Woo-hoo! Take his stick and go! The Jade Emperor will see you home. [Lin grunts] What are you going to do to him? That selfish creature doesn’t care about you. Run! [sighs] [Wangmu] Ya! [Monkey King yells] Ha ha! Stick, where are you? Who',\n",
       "  'a! Back for more, Monkey? Uh-oh. [panting] Don’t look back! Don’t look back! Don’t look back. [Monkey King screams in pain] [Wangmu laughs] No, not this time. [Wangmu laughs] Goodbye, mortal. Half-mortal. [Monkey King groans] You couldn’t possibly think you were worthy to take your place here amongst us Immortal Ones. [Wangmu laughs] That was fun. [door opens] Huh? Monkey! Agh! Agh! [dramatic music plays] What? Oh ho ho! I love it when people tell me what I can’t do. [Wangmu grunts] [Monkey King yells] [laughs] Whoa! [laughs] [gasps] My lightning makes you stronger? I’m immortal! [Stick squeals excitedly] And huge! I’m one of you now. You will never be one of us! Monkey! Who’s gonna stop me? I summon the Immortal Ones! I’m already here! [Lin] They’re coming! We gotta get out of here! What are they gonna do? I can’t die. There are fates far worse than death. We really should go now. Bring ’em on! I am a god. Monkey! What? I’m busy! Bet you can’t catch me. Monkey King! [gasps] [Lin yells] He’s coming. He’s coming. He’s coming. He’s not coming! [Lin yells] [triumphant music plays] [panting] You came back for me. What’s your deal? You came back for me! I so could’ve beaten that old lady. But you didn’t because you care. No. Admit it. You care. Say it. No! Say, “I care.” Never. Come on, admit it! I admit nothing! He so cares about me. [Stick murmurs] I know! He was all like, “We’re not family. You’re a tiny pebble.” And then he saves me! [laughs] [Stick laughs] Are you two done? ‘Cause I got to get to the Jade Palace. To do what? Defeat all the Immortal Ones. Then I’ll become their ruler, the new king of heaven. Wait. Are you sure? Sounds kinda crazy. Yep! Whatever the Monkey King does, he does big! And you won’t ever stop? Not until the day I die. Which is? Never! I’m immortal! My thirst for new challenges will never end. I’ll never be satisfied. I’ll never be fulfilled. Which, when I say it out loud, sounds incredibly depressing. Wow! Did I just curse myself? [Stick groans] Maybe defeating everyone isn’t always the answer. Maybe you’d find happiness by, I don’t know, helping other people? That could be your new, uh, path. Hm. Say you could save a starving village by lending out the stick for… My stick? Okay. How about I rip off my tail and give that away too? I mean, come on. You could save the lives of so many. Hard pass. Me and Stick are meant for way bigger things. You wanna be happy, you help people. You can do great things. I’m just a mortal. You’re the only mortal I know who’s gone to hell and heaven in one day. That wasn’t my accomplishment. That was you. When we were in hell, I read my scroll. It said, “Lin, common peasant girl.” “Tried to make a difference. Never did.” [sighs] Does it have to end that way? I don’t know. Who’s Lin? I’m Lin. Oh! Hey, Lin. Monkey King. Nice to meet ya. Pleasure. Buck up, Lin. No one thought I could make a difference, right? But now look at me. The original outsider. Fully immortal! So don’t let anyone, god, demon, old monkeys, challenge you or stand in your way. You want something, don’t ask. Just take it. [Stick grunts] I’ve got a challenge. Go on. It’s a big one. I’m listening. How long do you think an immortal monkey can hold his breath under that water? Interesting. I dunno. Two, three years! [inhales deeply] [Stick murmurs] [Lin grunts] [strains] [soft music plays] Don’t be sad. You’ve done good, girl. Go home. Your storm is coming. [Babbo and Benbo laugh] [soft music continues] [Lin grunts] Ah, I wasn’t gonna make you wait the whole three. Forget it. Come on. Grab Stick, and we’ll… Where’s Stick? I had no choice. He just needs to borrow it. Borrow it? Where did you get that? The Dragon King just… Dragon King? My village is dying. My family is dying. The Dragon King can help them. I trusted you, Lin. I saved you. I saved you first. And I asked for your help. You said if I want something, don’t ask. Just take it. That’s what you said. [Monkey King growls] I had to do it. Ha! [yells] [',\n",
